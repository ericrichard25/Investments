Summary: AAOI is an optical communications equipment maker that supplies fiber equipment to datacenter and cable TV customers.

Anticipate 1Q18 inventory headwinds from one customer, and typical seasonality due to fewer production days in China given Lunar New Year. Its a good sign that they were able to maintain decent margins of 40% vs 38% even though revenue was lower. 

1Q18 guidance: revs 67-71M, non-GAAP gross margin 41%, non-GAAP net income 6M. 

***Simultaneously announce a purchase agreement with FB for 125M of optical communication equipment in 2018, and expect FB to make a forecast for equipment needs for 2019 and 2020.

10/12/17: 3Q 2017 prelim earnings revenue down to 89M from 111M, net income down to 19M from 28M. Mainly due to lower than expected sales to one datacenter customer. This customer was 10% of total revenue vs 47% last quarter. Based on conversations with customer management believes disruption is caused from transition from 40G to 100G and nothing to do with AAOI. Also does not believe any inventory impairment will occur. Remain in active qualification for new 100G and 200G products with customers outside of core customer base. At midpoint of lowered revenue range, still grew 26% YOY. Assuming ""large customer"" refers to Amazon, even though Amazon revenue was down from 47% to 10% for the quarter, still managed almost 90M, with net income of 20M. For the year that would be 80M net income, so forward PE would be 12. Not a screaming buy based on PE, but this is a consistently profitable tech company gearing up for a structural shift from 40G to 100/200G in the datacenter industry that is coming. Also only 23M in debt. Still think it is a buy but weight is already high so not sure about adding to position.'\n''\n''\n'",,3,6,16.48,0.00,0,0,0,0.00

AAVVF,3.15,3.15,2017-11-18,5.50,"AAVVF QR: Cash 25M, pos. All Canadian natural gas producers have been pushed down, primarily because of the drop in the AECO price (Alberta gas index). Pipelines are operating at max capacity, with a shortage of new construction and maintenance work exacerbating the problem. AAV is seeing strong cashflow and is currently profitable, but their good cashflow is aided in large part by their excellent hedging results. They have already said they will be lowering natural gas production in 2018 in response to low price periods and to preserve dry gas productivity for higher price periods, shifting resources towards liquid drilling. But this will be a slow process. The forward PE does not make this compelling. Neither does the fact that they are funding capex with debt, as adj funds flow has been less than capex for two quarters now. Pass.

The stock did extremely well up until the fall of 2018 as sales of Impella ramped up to over $800M per year. Since hitting $400/share, however, sales growth has declined. This is likely related to a pair of studies claiming that bleeding rates and patient outcomes are worse with Impella than with much cheaper legacy, lower-tech devices such as IABPs. ABMD has countered that the studies were flawed due to a much sicker patient pool and is running additional trials to clear up the confusion. With market penetration of only 20% or less across the Western world, there is still considerable room to grow (2, slide 45). But its still unclear how high of a market share they will capture given the unanswered questions over Impella. Pass.

EVENTS:'\n''\n'2/20/19: -60%. 4Q18 misses big on EPS, and the file for bankruptcy to facilitate the sale of the Chemicals segment (for 338M) and the stalking horse sale of the Rising segment. doesnt seem like a buying opportunity. with the sale of the Chemicals segment for 338M, cash is now 380M and total assets are 1,091M. But is we subtract inventory of 184M and intangible assets of 221M, then the hard/liquid assets are only 686M. Total liabilities are 763M. They are also going to sell the Rising segment, but this is the segment that has performing very poorly and caused the stock to decline this year.

The failure to supply penalties should continue to decrease, as they were able to get the number of SKUs on back-order down from 22% to 4%. The strategic review will likely result in a partial/full sale of the company, which will be used to pay down some debt. The other segments are doing ok and so are worth having a small position in. '\n''\n'9/28/18: -7%. 4Q18 missed big on EPS, as there was a 15M penalty because they could not supply a needed chemical to a customer. But this issue is being worked out. The Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Performance Chemicals segments continue to grow and remain very profitable, but the Human Health segment continues to drag down results. Management would not comment at all on the ongoing strategic review, but their lenders must see value here, or else they would not have offered debt covenant waivers through mid-2019. Without the 15M supply penalty, adj net income of -17M would have been close to break-even.'\n'https://seekingalpha.com/pr/17284420-aceto-reports-fiscal-2018-fourth-quarter-full-year-results
'\n'9/26/18: -7%. ACET will be dropped from the SmallCap index since it isnt representative of the space anymore.'\n''\n'7/17/18: +2%. Court rules that the Buy America Act permits the purchase of domestic end-products even if some components were not made in the US. The government had previously terminated 11 VA contracts with an ACET subsidiary after claiming that ingredients were being sourced from India. Governemnt has 60 days to appeal.'\n'
5/4/18: +9%. 3Q18 obtained a waiver for financial covenants (it is too early to tell for next quarter). They remain at break-even profitability, sustained by the stable cash-generating businesses of Pharmaceuticals Ingredients and Performance Chemicals. 

However, two new concerns emerged during the quarter. First, the VA notified them that some of their ingredients are not being sourced from US suppliers. They are working on resolving this issue. Second, they incurred a 10M penalty for failing to deliver certain chemical supplies to a customer. They anticipate another penalty in 4Q18, but that this should be the tail end of the penalties, as they are billed for missed shipments in previous quarters. 

4/19/18: -60%. ACET is negotiating with lenders to waive leverage and debt service covenants to avoid a default, taking a 230-260M asset impairment charge, and pulling guidance from February due to continued competitive generic pricing pressure. The CFO has also resigned and has hired an outside advisor to conduct a strategic review of business.

2/1/18: 2Q18 revs 171M, +36% YOY. Gross margin 20% vs 25%. Net income 0M (excludes 14M charge for tax reform). Still seeing pricing pressure from greater competitive intensity and customer consolidations. Dont think pricing environment will improve this year, 2H18 figures will be only slightly better than 1H18. FY18 guidance for revs to increase 10-15%, non-GAAP EPS 1.00-1.05.

11/3/17: 1Q 2018 earnings saw net sales of 185M vs 128M, up 45% YOY but largely due to acquisition of 55M worth of products of Citron and Lucid.  Gross margin was 22% vs 24% YOY. SGA expense was 31M, up 48% from 21M due to 5.4M in amortization expense associated with purchase of intangible assets related to Citron and Lucid purchases. Also 4.1M of one-time costs associated with departure of CEO. Net income did drop to 0.5M, a 90% decrease due to lower gross margins and higher expenses. Cash flow did allow for pay-down of 24M of debt. Things moving in the right direction with Rising Pharmaceuticals business, Citron, and Lucid products, and expense synergies will realize 4M of gain. Is lowering 2018 guidance due to continued generic pricing pressure, and some product launches will be delayed. 2018 EPS guidance of 1.00  1.32 gives a forward PE of 9.8  7.4.

However, the Hepatitis C part of the pipeline has been discontinued, and the focus is now on early stage Factor D inhibitor candidates going after the same market as Soliris, which had 2016 US net sales of $1.1B (mainly for PNH indication). The early data that was released for the second-generation candidate ACH-5228 was very promising, as its much more potent than the first generation candidate danicopan and showed a greater than 95% sustained mean inhibition of the alternative pathway. But without the data for LDH reduction, we arent yet able to make a direct comparison to Soliris (which blocks terminal complement pathway activation), so I cannot fully complete the peak sales estimates. The market cap is about $600M, so subtracting the $241M of cash means their pipeline is being valued at about $360M. Difficult to say whether its mispriced.

PIPELINE: '\n''\n'RHOFADE (rosacea=redface): Commercialized in 2017 by AGN. US market size 16M. The only good current option is a laser procedure (requires 3 visits). In 2015, US dermatologists performed 452K (151 patients) laser procedures for rosacea. Bernstein thinks some patients will prefer the daily cream and expects peak sales of 300M (2).'\n''\n'AGN had acquired it in 2011 after it was developed by members of ACRS management. ACRS acquired it on 10/16/18 for 65M upfront plus royalties of mid-single to mid-teens of net sales. RHOFADE is expected to be accretive to Aclaris EBITDA beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019. The side effects profile of the drug looks attractive, with dermatitis, pruritus and application site erythema as main adverse reactions.'\n''\n'ESKATA (A-101 40% Topical Solution w/w) (SK): US Commercial launch 2Q18. Approved 12/15/17. Licensed to Cipher Pharma in Canada. First FDA-approved medication for SK (only surgical options are cryosurgery and curettage). Cryosurgery generally leaves minimal/no scarring, but there is a small chance of slight skin discoloration. Curettage is a sometimes painful scraping procedure that may involve bleeding. It generally leaves minimal/no scarring, but there is a small chance of slight skin discoloration. Eskata is applied by a dermatologist with a pen-like applicator and is non-invasive.'\n''\n'Market research shows that in the US, 83M have SK, 18.5M patients visit a dermatologist each year, and 8M end up getting treatment. There are 5M people with lesions on the face, 83% of SK patients are interested in treatment, 73% of females with SK have tried to disguise, hide, or remove lesions themselves, and 42% of males have tried to do so. Company research alse shows that patients would pay between $185 (rural) and $424 (age 40s), with an avg out of pocket payment of $333 (1). A-101 is much cheaper than Botox, lasers, or fillers. '\n''\n'Phase 3 met primary and secondary endpoints. The before and after pictures from company presentation are remarkable, showing lesions on the face almost completely vanishing. Local skin reactions were mild to moderate and similar to placebo group.

A-101 45% topical solution (common warts, once weekly): Phase 3 will commence 2H18. Common warts effects 22M in US. No FDA-approved treatments for warts. Well-tolerated thus far. 3/19/18: Announced positive 3-month follow-up data. At day 134, mean reduction in PWA score was 1.0 points vs 0.39 for placebo(p=0.0004). 1/8/18: Announced that WARTS-203 trial met primary and all secondary endpoints. The mean reduction in physician wart assessment (PWA) score at Day 56 on the target warts was 0.87 points in patients who received A-101 45%, compared to a reduction of 0.17 points for the target warts that received placebo, a result that was statistically significant (p&lt;0.001).

SUMMARY: 

EVENTS: '\n''\n'12/10/20 B): +2%. AcelRx Pharmaceuticals (ACRX -4.3%) has entered into an agreement with three life sciences-focused investment funds that are existing investors and new investors in AcelRx, for the sale of 8,333,333 shares at $1.20 per share. Gross proceeds $10M. Market price 1.39 (discount 14%). q1'\n''\n'11/5/20 AH: -7%. 3Q20. Cash 43M, burn 8M. No new DSUVIA orders announced. Progress continues to be slow. q1'\n''\n'9/14/20 BO: +18%. DSUVIA access has been expanded to the Department of Defense's Joint Deployment Formulary (JDF) beyond Milestone C approval for army sets, kits and outfits. JDF is a core list of pharmaceutical products that are designated for deploying military units across all service branches. q1. 1%.'\n''\n''\n'8/19/20 BO: +14%.

Cash 54M, burn 7M. No change. q1. 1%.'\n''\n''\n'7/17/20 AH: +18%. AcelRx Pharmaceuticals shares are trading higher after it was announced the company won a $3.5 million US Army medical research acquisition contract for Dsuvia. q1. 1%.'\n''\n''\n'5/11/20 AH: -11%. 1Q20. Cash 53M, burn 15M. AcelRx expects that initial stocking orders beginning later this year for U.S. Army SKOs alone will approximate $30 million over the next three years based on troop deployment schedules. AcelRx is aware of the May 8, 2020 disclosure by Tetraphase indicating it received a competing acquisition proposal from La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company (La Jolla) that the Tetraphase board of directors (Tetraphase Board) believes constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior offer. The La Jolla proposal is for an upfront value of $22 million, payable in cash. This compares to the AcelRx proposal for an upfront value of approximately $21.7 million payable in stock. Regardless of whether the Tetraphase Board ultimately chooses to accept an offer (including the La Jolla offer) other than the AcelRx transaction under the Merger Agreement, the co-promotion agreement between the two companies would remain in place  safeguarded by significant financial obligations. If a party other than AcelRx ultimately combines with Tetraphase, they will promote DSUVIA and AcelRx will continue to promote XERAVA. q1. 1%.'\n''\n'4/30/20 BO: +3%. Milestone C decision clears the way for the military to begin procuring DSUVIA. Also announced prelim 1Q20 results and slightly reduced expense guidance for 2020. q1. 1%.'\n''\n'3/16/20 BO: -17%. 4Q19. Cash 66M, burn 13M. No surprises from preliminary results announced 1/13/20. They continue to get hospitals to add DSUVIA to their formularies but no material sales or sales guidance yet. Confirmed timing for April 2020 DSUVIA Milestone C meeting with the Department of Defense, with procurement recommendation expected post-meeting. q1. 1%.'\n''\n'Also co-announced the execution of a merger agreement to acquire Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (TTPH) in a stock for stock deal valued at $14.4 million as of the close of trading on March 13, 2020, plus a contingent value right (CVR). Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of Tetraphase common stock will be converted into the right to receive 0.6303 shares of AcelRx common stock, and a CVR that could provide up to an additional aggregate $12.5 million to Tetraphase stockholders upon the achievement of net sales of XERAVA of $20 million, $35 million and $55 million within the applicable timeframes, and as soon as year-end 2021. AcelRx shareholders will own approximately 85.4% of the combined company and Tetraphase shareholders will own approximately 14.6% on a pro forma. Closing of the transaction  expected in the second quarter of 2020  is subject to Tetraphase having a defined cash level at closing and receipt of approval of its shareholders. The transaction does not require a vote by AcelRx stockholders.'\n''\n'It looks like they gave away 15% of the company for a product (XERAVA) that only had sales of 3.6M in 2019, so ACRX stock price reaction seems justified. I dont know anything about it but you can tell from TTPH stock price that their investors have been disappointed so far. The long thesis here continues to depend on DSUVIA sales. So far no guidance or meaningful growth.'\n'																'\n'1/13/20 BO: -1%. Cash 66M, burn 11M. Announce 4Q19 preliminary revs and formulary wins. They have exceeded their 2019 goals of 125 formulary approvals and 125 REMS-certified facilities (148 and 166, respectively) but 2019 sales are still very small at only $2.3M. Department of Defense Milestone C meeting for DSUVIA is expected in the second quarter of 2020; the Company expects the military to begin procuring DSUVIA following successful completion of this meeting.

On the call they had a doctor (paid consultant) talk about the early use of Dsuvia at his Minnesota hospital. They arent seeing any adverse side effects, nurses like it, surgeons that use it in ASCs outside of the hospital are coming back to the hospital and saying they want to start using it there too. Things seem to be moving in the right direction, but sales remain very small since most places place very small initial orders to test it out. But they are starting to see some reorders come in. No discussion of military orders on the call. Ex-US partnership talks still ongoing. Until they give some type of sales guidance, I dont see this going back up.

Also since they are commercializing alone in the US the cash burn for 2019 will increase. The earnings call had a lot of positives (strong early interest from hospitals, raising expected formulary wins for 2019 from 100 to 125, clarified some of the misconceptions, etc.), but it was all qualitative. The various branches of the military are working on approving Dsuvia for purchase. But it might be 3 months to 1 year before some of the large institutions approve its purchase. One piece of good news is that they will automate most of the Dsuvia production process this year, reducing costs by 60%. No action. q1. cp 127k. tp 40k.'\n''\n'11/9/18: -17%.

On the post-approval conference call, management did not have any updates on the EU partnership, DOD orders, gave no sales guidance, etc. They did mention that dsuvia wholesale pricing would be $50-60/pill, with the DOD likely receiving the usual 25% discount to commercial customers. I think the market just does not like the slow rollout of the salesforce. They will start with about 10 and build up to 60 by 2020, targeting about 3K hospitals in the US.'\n''\n'11/2/18: +16%.

PIPELINE:

DSUVIA (Dzuveo in EU) (moderate to severe acute pain): FDA approval 11/2/18. EU approval 6/27/18. US launch January 2019 (will increase the number of sales reps slowly, reaching 60 reps after 6 quarters and only starting with 5-10). Management estimates: Peak sales from both company and analysts $1B+ (1, 2). Dsuvia will cost 50-60/pill, with the DOD likely receiving the customary 25% discount to commercial customers. ACRX is initially going after two segments: emergency department (18M US receive IV for pain only) and outpatient surgery (US 11M). DSUVIA development actually began at the request of the Department of Defense, who was looking for a replacement for IV-delivered morphine on the battlefield. The DOD has already pre-ordered 100K units (pending approval). At $50 per unit, there is already $5 million in sales waiting.

ZALVISO (acute pain): Approved in EU. Up for approval in US soon. EU commercial partner Grunenthal Group began selling it in April 2016. The majority of the EU royalty stream was sold to PDL in September 2015, so the contribution is expected to be minimal. Zalviso has the potential to address several key disadvantages of IV PCA, including lowering the risk of infections related to IV access, being non-invasive, enhancing ease of mobility (Zalviso does not tether the patient), and lowering the risk of pump programming errors (Zalviso is pre-programmed).'\n''\n'GLOSSARY:'\n'GPO: Group Purchasing Organization'\n''\n''\n'SOURCES:'\n'1. <a href=""https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/11/acelrx-pharmaceuticals-inc-is-soaring-should-you-b.aspx"" style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); --darkreader-inline-bgcolor:#181a1b;"" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="""">https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/11/acelrx-pharmaceuticals-inc-is-soaring-should-you-b.aspx</a>",,3,6,1.95,2.17,0,0,0,1.00

TRILOGY 1 data showed that CaPre failed to sufficiently separate from placebo in terms of reducing triglyceride levels (median reduction in the CaPre arm was 30.5% versus 27.5% in the control arm at week 12). The observed reductions in triglyceride levels in the placebo group were far greater than that seen in any previous triglyceride lowering trial with a prescription omega-3. The placebo used in the TRILOGY trials is simple cornstarch, which is a complex carbohydrate with a low glycemic index, and consequently would be expected to have a neutral effect on key biomarkers of patients in the placebo group. In similar previously conducted triglyceride lowering trials involving prescription omega-3 preparations, the placebo responses (using corn oil, olive oil, or vegetable oil) ranged from a change of +16% to -17% across 18 interventions arms, with 14 of 18 arms ranging between +10% to -10%. Given that cornstarch is likely not the root cause for the significant placebo response in TRILOGY 1, the Company is carefully evaluating other possible explanations. The Company has noted that a high placebo response at 5 sites (out of a total of 54 enrolling sites) disproportionately contributed to the overall placebo response, and is being further investigated. A full audit of these sites, including review of all raw data and records from patients taking both CaPre and placebo, will be conducted to identify a possible root cause of the unprecedented placebo effect. This audit is likely to take at least several weeks, with an outcome expected by the end of February 2020. Additional avenues of investigation will include further assessment related to specific continuation or discontinuation of other lipid lowering drugs during screening, and changes in the use of other lipid-lowering medications during the trial. Furthermore, the results of the ongoing TRILOGY 2 trial with CaPre may provide additional important information and insight in this regard. Stays in q5. cp 0k.'\n''\n''\n'12/23/19 intraday: -24%.

I wouldn't be surprised if the indicted head of global basketball brands decides to cooperate and give up information on more senior people.

Well-known biotech fund Perceptive Advisors owns 20% of the equity, having just bought $16M worth of shares in February 2020 at $3.50/share. There have been lots of insider buys for several years at prices much higher than $2.00/share. Jefferies thinks a buyout price could come in the range of $10-$16/share (1).

SYMJEPI (epinephrine manual injector): Approved in June 2017. US launch early 1Q19. Expanded approval for use in patients under 65 pounds approved on 9/27/18. Signed a commercialization agreement with Sanoz on 7/2/18, but no upfront and milestone payments disclosed. ADMP will receive 50% of net profits. 

Designed to compete with MYLs EpiPen, which has been in the news a lot due to large increase in price and some patient deaths. Some other competitors in this space with MYL, Kaleo, IPXL, and TEVA. MYL and Kaleo (Auvi-Q) injectors both received recalls. TEVA received approval on 8/16/18. 

The market is at least 1.1B. SA analysts seem to think ADMP should capture at least 20%, given that Symjepi is half the size of a regular EpiPen and will be much cheaper. 15% of market is hospitals and health care providers. The other 85% is private consumers. Of the private consumers, approximately 15% of EpiPen injections are done wrong, with parents frequently injecting themselves instead of the child.

They acquired the global rights to competitor Osmoticas Osmolex on 12/2/20 for $8M, so that de-risks this slightly. But the concern in the CNS space continues to be that the drugs (even the approved ones like Gocovri) simply add no clinical benefit.

There is also a risk that competitor Osmoticas Osmolex will be prescribed off-label for PD-LID (a parkinsons indication). The active ingredient in both Gocovri and Osmolex are the same, though Osmolex never completed two phase 3 trials for this indication (no reason given for discontinuation). Now that the phase 3 trial in MS has read out (and we see that the results are not very meaningful), there is nothing to hope for here. Pass.

However, since response was defined as at least a 20% improvement in walking speed from baseline to 12 weeks post-treatment, as measured by the Timed 25 Foot Walk, this is not very meaningful. It seems that they are not sure they will even continue with program: . . .

After 1.5 years on the market, annual sales will end up being in the 50M+ range. Its not looking too good for the current indications.

They also would not comment on their previous long-range target of 20-30% market share. QOQ revs growth continues to decline and is now at +21%.

Commercialization of Gocovri is going very well. Management think some payers will cover competitor Osmolex, but since they have no clinical data to back up their claims of efficacy, they dont think the off-label use will be so widespread.

Gocovri (Levodopa-induced Dyskinesia in Parkinsons Disease (PD)): Approved August 2017 as first and only treatment for this indication. Commercialized January 8, 2018. Levodopa is most effective therapy for PD but long-term usage is associated with dyskinesia. This is one reason why not commonly prescribed to patients under 50.

Priced at 28,500/yr. Market size 150K-200K in US. Management long-term target is 25-30% market share. Using midpoint of 175K gives about 5B in sales. Assuming 10% market share gives 500M. Wall St peak sales are 250M-500M.'\n''\n'On 10/8/18 (2) they announced final results from a 2-yr phase 3 study that showed a sustained treatment effect in reducing dyskenesia. The safety profile remained consistent with previous results.

2/20/18: Steady decline over 20% on news that Osmolexs Osmotica has been approved by FDA for Parkinsons disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal reactions in adult patients. Osmotica has the same active ingredient as Gocovri, so the concern is that physicians will prescribe it off-label for PD-LID since it may be cheaper. Osmotica was granted Orphan designation in 2015 for a PD-LID trial, but the trial was terminated (no info as to why), so they have no efficacy data for this indication. They also concurrently have filed an action in Delaware federal court requesting a declaratory judgement that Osmolex does not infringe on ADMS patents. There is much debate on SA as to whether this is a material event or not for ADMS. ADMS management said on the 4Q17 call that the extent of the similarities is only the active ingredient.   

ADS-5102 (MS Walking): Phase 3 INROADS initiated 2Q18. Only one FDA-approved drug for MS walking, only effective in a subset of population. Announced positive phase 2 data on 2/1/18 (1) which showed a statistically significant 17 percent improvement in walking speed from baseline and that a greater proportion of ADS-5102-treated patients experienced at least a 20 percent improvement in walking speed from baseline.

ADS-5102 was generally well tolerated in this study population. One serious adverse event was reported in the study, suspected serotonin syndrome, reported as drug related by an investigator. The most frequent adverse events (AEs) reported in the ADS-5102 treatment group were dry mouth, constipation and insomnia. Five ADS-5102 patients and no placebo patients discontinued treatment due to AEs.

ADS-5102 (PD additional indication): Phase 2 complete.

1/17/18: -7% as 1Q18 results will be significantly hurt by headwinds affecting the SS&M business. Margins will likely take a modest step backwards for 2018. The headwinds are commodity prices/availability (mainly steel), launch inefficiencies (complexity associated with global programs, demand outpacing supply resulting in additional outsourcing/tooling), steel supply constraints driving freight costs, and the cost of customer interruption.

AERI is a biotech focused on eye treatments for glaucoma, dry eye, etc. The stock climbed to $75/share during 1H18 on a mix of continued good results and regulatory updates for lead candidates Roclatan and Rhopressa (both for glaucoma), but has since drifted down to $9/share on repeated sales guidance reductions for both drugs. As of 2Q20, combined sales were only $18M (+14%), casting serious doubt on management's combined global peak sales estimate of $1B (1). It's still only been 1-2 years since the US launches, but even with eventual approval in the EU and Japan this figure seems very exaggerated. The rest of their pipeline is early stage, and as with other eye companies such as OCUL, I am skeptical of their claim that there are 27M untreated dry eye patients in need of a new alternative.

The study met its primary endpoint of showing superiority over each of its components, Rhopressa (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02% and latanoprost, as measured by baseline IOPs from above 20 to below 36 mmHg for each of nine time points. In addition, Roclatan lowered average IOP to 16 mmHg or lower in 61% of patients, significantly higher that the comparator arms.

Once-daily combo drop of Rhopressa and latanoprost, the most widely-prescribed drug for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma. Management peak sales estimate $1B (for both Rhopressa and Rocklatan) and 40% glaucoma market share (1). As of October 2020 Rhopressa had 1% glaucoma market share (2, slide 5). The goal is to take market share from Latanaprost (43%). In Europe the market leaders are latanaprost (20%) and Ganfort (20%). They have shown non-inferiority against Ganfort (which is not approved in the US) and requires a 2x-4x daily dose, so the once-daily dosing is the only advantage here. They have shown better efficacy against Rhopressa alone and latanoprost alone (4, slide 5) (about 20% better than either), but it's not clear how game-changing the combined benefit is. Also, some doctors were simply prescribing Rhopressa + generic latanoprost, which does require taking two drops instead of one. Rocklatan costs $300/month (5), Rhopressa costs $300/month (6), and generic latanoprost costs $10/month. Pfizer's Xalatan (latanoprost) did $1B+ in sales in 2003 (8) but is now generic.

On 10/9/18, the stock dropped 25% on the news that two of its T cell trials (for AFM11) were placed on hold due to 3 SAEs.

Cash: 44M, burn 7M

Catalysts: 1Q18 (FDA meeting update)

Summary: AGRX has three other trials ongoing but they all revolve around contraceptive patches.

Twirla (AG200-15): Has previously received a CRL from FDA citing need for further trial. After price rose leading up to follow-up study, price dropped again from efficacy results that werent a slam dunk. Recent CRL on 12/22/17 cited 3 issues: 1) quality adhesion test method, 2) Coriam manufacturing facility, 3) NVIVO adhesion properties. 

On the follow-up call, management said an amendment was actually submitted on Dec 1, and that the CRL acknowledged that it has been received but that it had not been reviewed prior to the decision. Management seems genuinely perplexed as to the rejection, as they believe all the data the FDA needs is in front of them. Their amendment even incorporated the recommendations that the FDA had given to them regarding the quality adhesion test method. They believe they might just have to provide further analysis of the data.

On the plus side the CRL has nothing to do with safety. There was a 51% discontinuation rate during the follow-up phase 3 trial, but other products have had discontinuation rates as high as 40%, so it is common for this type of trial. 

The PEARL score (a measure of pregnancies per 1,000) of 4.8 is high compared to other products, and the FDA does seem to be wondering if the adhesion properties of the patch are affecting efficacy. Ultimately, the commercial success of the Twirla doesnt seem guaranteed given the higher PEARL numbers, but the CRL issues seem resolvable, and approval seems likely.

1/2/18: announces favorable tolerability profile. QIDP-tagged C-Scape is an oral combination of ceftibuten, a third-generation cephalosporin, and clavulanate, a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Both are already approved in the U.S. as monotherapies, so chance of success 90%+ (SA).

PIPELINE:

Zemdri (plazomicin) Market Opportunity: 1.5M days of once-daily IV treatment for 30 min. Peak sales estimate 350-550M for both indications combined (the street, SA).

Total patients US/EU 11M = 6M (cUTI) + 2M (pneumonia) + 3M (BSI/sepsis)
Confirmed CRE opportunity = ~1M days = 180K cases x 5-14 days of therapy
Suspected CRE opportunity = ~0.5M days = 280K x 1-3 days therapy 
Total = 1.5M days of therapy

Zemdri (plazomicin) (urinary tract infections (UTI)): Approved 6/26/18. US commercialization 7/20/18. MAA submission 10/17/18. At 2Q18, more than 75% of high-priority accounts have been engaged in the first two weeks by the sales team. Break Through Designation. 

Achieved primary FDA endpoints and also showed superiority on EMA endpoints. One case of potential ototoxicity in each treatment arm; both cases mild and recovered.

Zemdri (plazomicin) (serious bacterial infections due to CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriacae)) (BSI): FDA denies approval on 6/26/18 due to insufficient efficacy. AKAO will meet to discuss. MAA submission 10/17/18.'\n''\n'Lower mortality rates were observed for patients taking plazomicin as opposed to those with colistin therapy. The safety profile for the drug candidate was considerably better, with TEAEs related to renal function occurring in 16.7% of patients versus 38.1% of patients in the colistin therapy arm. Sufficiently differentiated itself compared to competitors products in clinical testing.

C-scape (oral) (ESBL + enterobacteriaceae): Phase 1. 2B global peak sales. US estimated patients 650K. By keeping patients with cUTI caused by ESBL G- out of the hospital for only 4-5 days C-scape would save about $10,000 to the healthcare system.

Types of antibiotics (% resistance)
Fluoroquinolones (85%). Ex: Levaquin. Cost 500mg (10 tablets): $137
Amoxicillin-clavulanate (56%). Generic cost 875mg (20 tablets):  $70
Cephalosporins (55%). Ex: Suprax (cefixime). Cost 100mg: $215
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (70%). Ex: Bactrim/Septra. Cost 800mg (20 tablets): $10. 

Company says a single phase 3 should be enough for approval. Antibiotic resistance is exhausting oral treatment options for cUTI and AP due to ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae.

Ex-US, however (where guidelines for target hemoglobin range are for 10-12 g/dL), the vadadustat line is clearly higher than Darbepoetin Alfa from week 0. The company continues to say that they will proceed with the NDA/MAA for both DD and NDD patients, but Its not clear how much non-dialysis revenue we should include in the model, so if the stock gets to $6 - $7 then we should think again about closing the rating (assuming there is no further commentary regarding the failed safety endpoint for PRO2TECT). q1'\n''\n''\n''\n'12/9/20 2.88 AKBA QR: Cash 269M, burn 50.

'\n'           The most likely is the discussion that took place on twitter today regarding the mention of Hys Law in the 2018 10-K that was filed on 3/26/19 (Hys Law is a rule of thumb observational checklist that a patient is at high risk of a fatal drug-induced liver injury). The section containing the reference to Hys Law pertains to one patient involved in a phase 2b trial from a few years ago (the results were published in the November 2016 issue of Kidney International) (3). In that article, the patient was described as having an increase in liver function test that was possibly related to vadadustat, but there was no mention of Hys Law. I have emailed AKBA IR to ask why no reference to Hys Law appears in any 10-K prior to 2018 even though the study in question is from pre-2018. Clearly there is a newfound concern regarding the toxicity of vadadustat&nbsp;magnified by the twitter discussion. '\n'           A second reason why it might be down is because Auryxia weekly script numbers were not impressive. A comment on stocktwits says that for the week ending March 15, total Rx revs for Auryxia was 2.28M. Multiplying by 12 gives 27.4M for the quarter. For 3Q18, Auryxia revs was 26.6M, which would mean only 3% QOQ growth (4Q18 Auryxia revs was only 24.7M due to two now resolved issues and so should be ignored). Previous QOQ revs growth was 10.3%, 16.9%, and 19.2%, so this weekly script number seems to go against managements claim on the 4Q18 earnings call that Auryxia script growth has returned to robust levels. However, there is a comment from March 29 that Auryxia scripts are roughly flat, so its not clear that todays comment is new information. I have messaged the commentator regarding when the scripts info came out.'\n'           Thirdly, Nantahala Capital Management decreased its stake in AKBA by 2.4M (51%).'\n'           Lastly, after close today they annouced inducement grants to new hires totalling 225K shares with an exercise price of 8.19/share. Market price 8.19/share (premium 0%). '\n'           This stays in q1, but the position seems large. cp 116k. tp 39k.'\n''\n'3/19/19: +1%. 4Q18. Cash 322M, burn 36M (up from 26M). Due to the merger they only announced preliminary results. Full results should be out within 15 days. Auryxia revs was 24.7M for 4Q18, down about 7% qoq. But this is because of an issue that has been resolved: DaVita Rx (the specialty pharma arm of DaVita) stopped shipping in September 2018, so patients being moved to other pharmacy providers caused some temporary disruptions. Also, script numbers were low to start 2019 but this is from an issue that has also been resolved: Come January 1, Medicare Part D patients who are prescribed Auryxia have to go through a prior authorization process which creates an administrative burden for the provider. But once prior authorization has been received, its good for the entire calendar year. Management says that looking at the Rx numbers coming out of March, it looks like robust Rx growth has resumed. But they dont want to give sales guidance yet until they feel more comfortable with what the normalized growth rate will be. The lack of guidance might also be a reason why its down AH.

Covered by Medicare Part D.'\n'Phosphate binders are the only interventions marketed for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. Phosphate binders need to be taken with meals and snacks, and it is not uncommon for DD-CKD patients to be prescribed as many as 12 or more phosphate binder pills per day, among other medications. Patients taking phosphate binders also experience gastrointestinal tolerability issues. As a result of the pill burden and tolerability issues associated phosphate binders, prescribed phosphate binders are often intolerable for many patients, leading to lack of treatment adherence and compliance. In addition, in 2016 approximately 55% of patients treated with a phosphate binder were treated with a calcium-based binder, which can lead to side effects such as increased cardiovascular risk, hypercalcemia and gastrointestinal-related adverse events. Due to the risks associated with calcium-based binders, in 2017 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes, or KDIGO, recommended that clinicians limit the use of calcium-based binders. Lanthanum-based phosphate binders are another alternative. Lanthanum is a rare earth element and is minimally absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Lower level tissue deposition, particularly in bone and liver, has been observed in animals, however, the long-term, potentially harmful, effects due to the accumulation of lanthanum in these tissues have not been clearly determined. Aluminum-type phosphate binders were widely used in the past. However, the systemic absorption of aluminum from these agents and the potential toxicity associated with their use no longer make this type of binder a viable long-term treatment option. (4, pg 8)
'\n'AURYXIA (ferric citrate) (IDA in NDD-CKD): Received label expansion on 11/6/17 for adults with IDA and CKD. However, in September 2018, CMS decided it would not be covered by Medicare for the IDA indication. AKBA is appealing. '\n'Currently, there are two forms of iron therapy used to treat IDA: oral iron supplements and iron delivered via intravenous infusion, or IV iron. Oral iron is currently the first-line iron replacement therapy for most physicians; however, oral iron supplements are poorly absorbed by many patients, which may adversely impact their effectiveness, and are associated with certain side effects, such as constipation, diarrhea and cramping, that may adversely affect patient compliance. IV iron is viewed as an effective treatment; however, like other intravenous medicines, it is logistically difficult to administer in an office setting, where NDD-CKD patients are more often treated.

VADADUSTAT (ACKD in adults with DD-CKD): Japan approval 6/29/20. In Japan, an estimated 13 million people are afflicted with advanced stages of CKD. Anemia is common in patients with CKD and its prevalence increases as CKD progresses. Injectable ESAs are currently the standard of care. Vadadustat, if approved for marketing, would provide patients with a once-daily oral treatment option and has the potential to set a new standard of care for the treatment of anemia due to CKD (2).

EVENTS:


11/7/19 BO: -50%. Announces positive phase 3 URIROX-1 results. Hit on primary endpoint (23% reduction in 24-hr UOx levels vs 10% placebo, p=0.004) but missed on a secondary endpoint. This is likely why its down. Could also be that investors wanted a reduction from baseline of at least 30%.


May 2018: Beginning of big decline. No specific news. Probably a combination of expected dilution, analyst downgrades, etc.

PIPELINE:


RELOXALIASE (enteric hyperoxaluria): Phase 3. Very compelling opportunity as there are no approved treatments for EH. Diet modification is often tried (i.e. avoiding spinach, cashews, etc.). ALNY and OxThera are researching treatments for PH but its a different indication. It would have been nice if the change from baseline for the first phase 3 trial had been at least 30%, but it came in at 23% and KOLs say that anything above 20% is clinically meaningful, as it reduces the change of kidnety stones by 25-50%. Potential blockbuster if successful.

The mispricing comes from the huge drop in August 2018, when a snafu at the FDA forced the company to conduct an additional phase 3 trial (the new FDA division did not honor the trial protocols that had been agreed to by the previous FDA division). After thousands of patients treated, it seems safe to conclude that Ampion is slightly better than Saline solution when it comes to reducing knee pain (pain reduction scores have been about 10%-15% better). The evidence of actual knee cartilage regeneration/repair, however, is very incomplete. Years ago, AMPE claimed that in a follow-up MRI study, only 40% (n=4/10) of Ampion-treated patients had required a total knee replacement, compared with 83% (n=5/6) of Saline-treated patients. Without more robust cartilage regeneration/repair data, we can only conclude that Ampion is slightly better at pain reduction.

AMRNs main candidate, Vascepa, has been on the market since 2013 when it was approved for a very narrow patient population (TG &gt; 500 mg) for lowering very high triglycerides (TG) (without raising bad cholesterol). The AdComm voted against giving Vascepa a broad label expansion (TG &lt; 500 mg) due to the unproven correlation between TG level and cardiovascular risk for people taking cholesterol-lowering statins. The results of the ensuing multiyear-yr study sent the stock soaring in September 2018, as all endpoints were met and Vascepa continued to be well-tolerated and relatively safe (only a few percentage points higher than placebo with respect to AEs). Since Vascepa is already approved, it was thought that no further AdComm would be neccessary, but on 8/8/19 the FDA announced that it would be holding an AdComm on 11/14/19, which is after the previously scheduled PDUFA in September. The drug is well-tolerated, so the main concern here is efficacy. While Vascepa generated a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 25% (compared with 15% for other anti-inflammatory medications), a comment on SA (1) says that over the past few years, some studies have come out concluding that their is no correlation between TG levels and CV events for patients on statins. I listened to the call when they announced the FDA AdComm. Management really had no extra info to give since they still dont know what exactly the FDA wants to talk about. But an analyst did bring up another potential issue. Mineral oil was used as the placebo instead of a sugar pill (this was decided with input from the FDA years ago) and there are comments on SA saying that the mineral oil possibly lowered the efficacy of the statins by blocking absorption. Management said they dont have any data to comment on that but its another risk to consider. The label expansion would obviously be a huge boon for AMRN, as the number of people taking statins are in the tens of millions. But its not clear that the newly requested AdComm is merely a formality, so I dont see this as a screaming buying opportunity. q3/q4.'\n''\n'CATALYSTS: 11/14/19 (Vascepa label expansion AdComm), end 2019?

There might also be a new Navy contract announcement soon. At 10M/vessel, they think they can work themselves into other ship designs.

In the event that Sinovel or Mr Wei (a guarantor shareholder) does not make the Second Payment by the Second Payment Due Date, the agreement provides that the non-exclusive license will terminate.'\n'
6/6/18 AH: -15%. 4Q17 missed slightly on revs but beat on EPS. But the revs guidance for 1Q18 is well below consensus. Installed wind capacity in India this past year was one third of what it was previous year. But INOX has had three recent auction wins, is growing their backlog, and should begin ramping up turbine production over the next few quarters. Korean turbine manufacturer Doosan is also looking for new projects outside of South East Asia. 

On the grid front, there should be news on the Chicago REG contract very SOON (management emphasis). They are also in talks with at least a dozen other cities about beginning a pilot REG study. And they have received exporting licenses for several different foreign Navys, so in the next few quarters there could be an order announced for their mine countermeasure system. 

The wild card remains the Sinovel case. Management expects that a fine will be imposed at the July 6 sentencing, but offered no other commentary during the call (though the recent 1.4B fine imposed on Chinese tech company ZTE is a good sign that the Chinese government will assist in make sure the fine is paid).

They have positioned themselves to be break-even at about 25M/quarter.

2/5/18: 3Q17 revs 15M, -45% YOY. Net loss (4.2M). Decrease in revenue due to lower ECS shipments to INOX. On a positive note, INOX did win two wind auctions in India and has resumed production. Grid segment delivered record revenues. 4Q17 revs guidance 12M-18M, net loss less than 7.5M. Cost savings from building sale and headquarter move should allow for break-even cashflow at under 25M in quarterly revenue.

PIPELINE:

Cchek platform (prostate cancer detection): Small-scale launch December 2019. Cchek is an AI-driven simple blood test that they hope will revolutionize cancer diagnostics. They partnered with Research Dx (a small regional pharmacy) to launch the test and complete all the CLIA validation studies. But the marketing and distribution of Cchek reamains under ANIX control. For this reason, they are in talks with several potential licensing partners because they think a larger distributor could scale it much more quickly (1, 25:00). The initial ramp-up will be very slow until a larger partner is found (1, 27:00). Each test costs $100 to run so they dont plan on charging anything close to the thousands of dollars that other liquid biopsy companies have projected (1, 30:15).'\n''\n'Cchek platform (breast cancer detection): Results announced on 7/30/18 showed sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 87% for stage 1 and 2 breast cancers, which are significantly better than mammography.'\n''\n'CAR-T therapy (ovarian cancer): Success rates in mice were 60% but they did say that other companies have seen excellent results in mice did not see any success in humans (1).

Summary: Background check figures continue to shows signs of future sluggishness. They are decreasing production to manage costs, and extended maturity on 75M senior notes due August 2020 during 3Q17.

3/1/18: 3Q17 misses on revs by 15M. Revs 157M, -33% YOY. Adjusted net income 4.7M vs 38M, EPS 0.09 vs 0.66. Gross margins 30% vs 43%. Poor results reflect a continuing challenging environment in firearms. Firearms declines were offset by double-digit revs growth in Outdoor Products segment, but at 40M, the segment is still small relative to the 117M from firearms.

12/7/17: 2Q earnings saw revs of 148M, -37% YOY. Gross margin 34% vs 42%. Net income 3.2M vs 32.5M. 3Q guidance revs 170-180M, EPS 0.07-0.10. FY revs 650M-675M, EPS 0.57-0.67.

The results were in-line with guidance but the forward guidance was slashed. Other brands such as RGR and VSTO are also having poor numbers compared with a year ago, when concerns for personal safety and fear of gun legislation during the election drove sales growth. 

1Q17: Much lower sales YOY (-38%) due to last years surge over concerns about potential anti-gun legislation. NICS results (FBI backgrounds checks) for August are up sequentially 13% from July. Backgrounds checks are not an exact proxy for future gun sales but a good sign that normal seasonality we have come to expect will play out. Expansion into 30B Outdoor market will mitigate the cyclical impact of firearm sales. Firearms sales 99M (down 49%), gross margins 27%. Outdoor sales 33M (up 123%), gross margins 45%. As Outdoor segments plays a larger part, margins will improve.

PIPELINE:

Vitaros (alprosdatil, DDAIP.HCl) (erectile dysfunction (ED) cream): Phase 3 complete (but FDA is requiring two more phase 3 trials to test at a lower concentration). Received second CRL on 2/16/18 due to CMC (chemistry, manufacturing, and control) deficiencies and safety concerns specific to 2.5% concentration of DDAIP.HCl. First CRL received on 7/21/08 (no additional studies were required). 

Original CRL issues were possible risk with permeation enhancer (DDAIP), safety risk to partner, and manufacturing issues. The FDA is concerned that DDAIP at 2.5% has tumor-causing properties, though no safety issues have been reported worldwide. One possible solution is to lower the concentration of DDAIP and do a short bridge study showing that the efficacy is still there.

There were two additional items included in this most recent CRL, but management is confident they can be resolved within a reasonable amount of time.   

Approved in 29 countries (Europe, Canada, Latin America, Middle East). This link is to a recent survey in France showing general satisfaction from physicians and patients.

Market size is 30M in US. Peak sales estimates range from 150M (SA) - 350M (management). 70% of men with ED are prescribed PDE-5 (Viagra), but 33% stop using it due to side effects or non-response. Expected Vitaros use is 20% of all ED patients (6M).  
 
Only topically delivered treatment for ED approved or in development. Would be the second line treatment before suppositories/injectables (i.e. MUSE requires an applicator be inserted into the tip of the penis to deliver alprosdatil, costs $420/6 uses). Viagra costs $50/pill, with Medicare reimbursing for 4 pills/month ($200) and private insurance 6 pills/month ($300).

Phase 3 efficacy data showed statistical significance to placebo at all doses, though efficacy is lower than Viagra.

Raynauds is an episodic vascoconstriction of the extremities affecting 3-5% of US population. Secondary Raynauds, affecting 500K in US, is driven by an underlying condition such as scleroderma, which affects 100K. Triggers include cold, stress, and vibration.

There were no other safety, clinical pharmacology/biopharmaceutics or CMC issues identified in the CRL. The FDA did cite a small number of protocol deviations in blood draws in one of the studies in the NDA. The Company believes, based on discussions with the FDA, that the Company will not need to conduct any further clinical studies in order to cure the items cited in the CRL, and will confirm that view in its upcoming follow-up meeting with the FDA.

Yosprala: Has been discontinued in US as of 4Q17. Big disappointment, but improving since 4Q16 when ARLZ launched new pricing program. Quarterly improvement has been +87%, +91%, +31%, but retail prescription equivalents (RPEs) still only 9K. Management had estimated 200M peak sales.

Vimovo: Royalty and licensing revenues in 3Q were 3.7M, down from 5.3M YOY due to lower pricing in US (which is licensed out to Horizon).

1. Why did you pay 2017 income tax expense of 2,400K if you had net losses for the year?  

2. What was the 2016 excise tax equalization payment of 12,043 for? 
Tax equalization is the offsetting of differences in taxation between countries so that working abroad is tax neutral. This 12M payment is related to the 2016 acquisition of Tribute (see below), a Canadian pharmaceutical company. ARLZ operates in Canada, Ireland, and the US. 

Pg 44 from 10-Q: In addition, net cash used in operating activities included expenses related to the acquisition of Tribute, including payments of transaction and product acquisition-related expenses of approximately $12.9 million, excise tax equalization payments of $12.0 million, and severance payments of $5.2 million. (Pg. 44)

3. What is your plan to refinance notes? 
In response to an analyst question about the timing of refinancing in 2018, management would only say that the movement towards positive adjusted EBITDA puts us in a better position to refinance.

4. Are people in US still able to buy Yosprala after discontinuation?

5. Does management own lots of shares?

In February, the FDA accepted ASRT partner West Therapeutic Developments NDA for reviewing the approval of this long-acting cosyntropin to diagnose adrenocortical insufficiency. But on the call they would not comment on their out look for revs regarding the achtar gel market with synthetic cosyntropin approved only as a diagnostic product. It is currently underway in an independently run investigator-led clinical study to investigate cosyntropin for the treatment of infantile spasm. However, this study is expected to take three to four years to complete and is not part of the current FDA diagnostic submission.

The company amended its existing licensing agreement with Applied Pharma Research to in-license a new presentation of Cambia that will offer a more convenient dosage form (will be patent protected through 2026 if approved). Additionally, DEPO entered into a new co-promotion relationship with Allegis Pharma for Zipsor. Allegis will supplements DEPOs existing sales force by adding 30 additional sales reps. Revenue will be shared above a pre-defined baseline. Previous Nucynta supply shortages have been resolved. Previous guidance reaffirmed. The news overall is good, but it still is not clear how much upside there is to total sales. The drugs have been on the market for several years but sales are still low and trending the wrong way. The sales force was expanded in Sep 2017 but we still do not see a reversal.'\n'
2/27/18: 4Q17 revs 94M, -24% YOY. EPS 0.15. FY17 revs 381M vs 456M. There were some supply issues with Nucynta during the quarter due to Puerto Rico hurricane but management says should return to normal levels by mid-March 2018.

In September 2017 expanded salesforce to 90 reps to focus on Gralise, Cambia, and Zipsor. These drugs have been on the market for a few years but sales are either declining or flat. Management thinks its a marketing problem not a product problem. 

Nucynta 60M vs 75M, Gralise 20M vs 25M, Cambia 8M vs 8M, Zipsor 4M vs 8M. Lazanda 2M vs 7M (has been divested).

12/4/17: Announces commercialization agreement with Collegium Pharmaceuticals. Collegium will commercialize both Nucynta Extended Release and Immediate Release and will pay a royalty. As long as agreement is in force, for the first 4 years DEPO will receive a minimum of 135M per year (Nucynta currently selling about 60M/quarter now). After year 4, the royalties remain the same but without a minimum. Because of this, DEPO will eliminate pain sales force and save 70M per year. Transaction closed 1/10/18.  

11/9/17: 3Q saw revs of 95M vs 110M, but main product Nucynta still seeing rev decline, 59M vs 65M YOY. Gralise saw small increase, 21.1M vs 20.6M. But all other products saw decline. They do plan on increasing the salesforce. 

Updated yearly guidance is lower, 375M  380M from 395M  410M.

The jump in price from earnings was likely due to a better than expected EPS, and also from the thinking that Nucynta will likely not be punished as harshly as the other opioid medications if regulations are enacted.'\n''\n'PIPELINE:'\n''\n'Cosyntropin (synthetic ACTH depot) (adrenal response test): Announced 2/6/20 that it no longer plans to pursue development. Plans to file for FDA approval by end 2018. No trials will be needed, as they will file a 505(b)(2) application as a biosimilar to MNKs acthar gel. The plan is to introduce it as a diagnostic tool (to trigger adrenal gland response in patients) before using it as a treatment option (see infantile spasms below). MNKs acthar gel had sales of 1B+ in 2017. It was approved in 1952 and is the only long-acting, alcohol-free synthetic ACTH analogue available in the US. The FDA recently released a list of drugs that are coming off patent with the hopes of introducing new competition into the marketplace to bring down costs. Acthar gel was on the list, as it costs 200K+ per year. It is derived from animal products (pig pituitary glands), and management says market research has shown that prescribers and patients would use a cheaper synthetic version if it was available. MNK has been selling a synthetic version, called synacthen depot, everywhere around the world excep the US (presumably so that it would not cannibalize its acthar gel revs). Management said on the 2Q18 call that they are not worried about it being imported to the US and that they think this is a risk they can manage (but no further explanation as to what that mean). It would stand to reason that if acthar gel is now off patent, MNK (or Sigma, another company selling it in the EU) would take this step to get ahead of the competition.

They are trying to develop oral formulations of widely used, injectable-only chemotherapy treatments. The goal of oral chemotherapy is to eliminate infusion-related reactions, reduce neuropathy (nerve damage), and allow for longer dosing durations to improve efficacy. Phase 3 results in metastatic breast cancer (12/13/19) did in fact show an improvement in efficacy and neuropathy compared with IV chemotherapy. But it looks like the oral formulation also increases gastrointestinal side effects, which is why the stock sold off on the news. It would seem like an acceptable trade-off, but as we have seen with PBYIs Nerlynx, severe gastrointestinal side effects can be enough to make patients decide to stop using the drug, even if it is to treat cancer. This seems like it should get a small position, but its too early to say that this will replace IV chemotherapy as the standard of care.

AVRO is a gene editing biotech investigating treatments for genetic disorders such as Fabry disease, Gaucher Type 1 disease, Cystinosis, etc. It dropped about 40% on 2/16/21 BO when BLUE announced that it was temporarily suspending a phase 1/2 trial (HGB-206) and a phase 3 trial (HGB-210) for LentiGlobin gene therapy for sickle cell disease. BLUE received a report a week prior that a patient who was treated more than five years ago in Group A of the HGB-206 trial was diagnosed with leukemia (AML). In addition, a patient from Group C of the HGB-206 trial was found to have myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). As a precaution, BLUE is also temporarily suspending marketing of ZYNTEGLO in the EU (approved in 2019 for transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia) because it is also manufactured using the same BB305 lentiviral vector as LentiGlobin. Its worth noting that thus far, no cases of malignancy have been reported in any patient who has received treatment with ZYNTEGLO (either in the trials or post-marketing). AVROs therapies are also derived from a lentiviral vector (as are the therapies of ORTX and RCKT), which is why the entire sector dropped. During the BLUE conference call (1), they said that the vector had been detected in the (AML) patient's tumor cells. The company is investigating since at this point, it's unknown whether the vector is merely a ""passenger"" here or it was responsible for the oncogenic mutations. The comments on SA are mixed as to what conclusion can be drawn at this point. Given that the AML patient was treated five years ago and that these are the first (and only) reported cases, it would seem that the newly formed cancers are unrelated to the gene therapies. But perhaps this is the beginning manifestation of what many have said all along: that gene editing will have very serious side effects long-term. Since the upside here from an AVRO recovery is many multiples higher than the downside, a small position is warranted. But since the odds of this bet are not clear (trial results thus far have also been promising but very early stage), it's not a top pick. q4  '\n''\n'8/27/20 17.40 AVRO QR: Cash 244M, burn 29M.

PIPELINE:

AXS-05 (treatment resistant depression (TRD)): Phase 3 STRIDE-1. Positive interim analysis thus far. 63% and 44% of patients have inadequate response to initial and secondary therapies. Only 1 approved drug for TRD. 45% of patients had greater than 50% reduction in MADRS score (p=0.01) in phase 2. Primary endpoint is reduction in MADRS score. '\n''\n'AXS-05 (MDD): Phase 2 ASCEND. One of the current standards of care for 2nd line treatment of MDD is bupropion. AXS-05 is a combo of Dextromethorphan + bupropion. Phase 2 results on 1/7/19 showed a clear separation in terms of efficacy for the combo vs bupropion alone.'\n''\n'AXS-05 (agitation in AD): Phase 3 ADVANCE-1. No approved treatment.  Phase 2 reduced agitation and aggression in AD by 46% vs 24% (p&lt;.001) for primary endpoint, and saw statistical significance in multiple secondary endpoints. Primary endpoint is change in score.

AXS-05 (smoking cessation): Phase 2 complete 4/15/19. Collaboration with Duke. Results from a head-to-head study vs approved drug Zyban showed AXS-05 did a bit better. Zyban did 139M in sales in 2012 but has faced generic competition since 2004 (was approved in 1997) (1). The anti-smoking market has lots of different treatment options so blockbuster sales dont seem likely (2).

AXS-02 (knee osteoarthritis with bone marrow lesions) (COAST-1): Phase 3 will continue, data during 2018.. Interim analysis showed significant reduction of serum CTx, a marker of bone resorption, as compared to placebo (p&lt;.0001). Safe and well-tolerated. SPA, Fast Track. However, an SA author published an article explaining the science behind AXS-02 and believes that while it may be safe, it will also likely fail based on futility (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4143297-axsome-potentially-pain-gain). 7M patients in US.

AXS-02 (chronic low back pain (CLBP) with modic changes (MC)): Phase 3 COAST-1. Recommended for continuation on 1/9/18.  1.6M patients US.

AXS-02 (complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)) (CREATE-1): Phase 3 discontinued for futility on 1/9/18. 80K new cases per year in US.

AXS-06 (OA and RA): Phase 3 ready. Being developed as a once-daily oral treatment with IV-like onset times. 120M NSAID TRxs per year in US.

AXS-07 (MoSEIC meloxicam + rizatriptan) (migraine): Phase 3 initiation anticipated in 2018, data 2019. Meloxicam is a new molecule for migraine. Phase 1 showed that max absorption time for MoSEIC meloxicam is 0.5 hours vs 4.5 hours for Mobic. Migraine market 37M in US.

CGRP PLATFORM

MIGRAINE MARKET: Affects 38M in US, with global market being $6B. The current class of drugs used to treat acute migraines are triptans. They work well but can cause serious cardiovascular side effects, and so are not suitable for people with high blood pressure. Management says 2B are unable to use triptans, and another 2B are unhappy with efficacy of triptans. Even with the side effects, sumatriptan formulations had 1.3B in global sales. In 2007, brand name Imitrex had 1.4B (though now generics are available).'\n'CGRP, a new class of drugs, will start at 6,500/yr (1) (as of 12/3/18, BHVN would not comment on pricing, but said that conceptually, the cost of preventative vs acute treatment should be similar). The field for preventive migraine treatment (via IV or subcutaneous monthly injections) is crowded. LLYs drug is called emgality, AMGN/NVSs drug is called aimovig, and TEVAs is called ajovy. All are expectd to hit peak sales of 1B+. However, BHNVs rimegepant is for acute migraine treatment. On the 12/3/18 call, management said that only 33% of migraine patients are eligible for preventative treatment, and of those, only 15-20% receive preventative treatment. But virtually all patients, whether on preventative treatment or not, take acute treatment. 

RIMEGEPANT ZYDIS ODT (small molecule/NCE for migraine): Phase 3 studies 301, 302, and 303 all complete. Oral, single 75mg dose. On 12/3/18 they announced results from 303, sending the stock up 25%. The efficacy and safety in the migraine trials continues to be excellent. Management says: Fast-acting and long-lasting pain relief in an easy to use formulation is important to patients.  Rimegepant provides these characteristics and we believe is the first oral CGRP receptor antagonist to report superiority over placebo on pain relief and return to normal functioning by 60 minutes'\n'

Thus far, BLU has shown a much better safety profile, but they missed on the primary endpoint for phase 2. However, when looking at just the subset of patients with extremely high cough counts, the results were highly statistically significant. This is probably enough to get the FDA to agree to a phase 3, but not convincing enough to make this a top pick, even though peak sales could be in the billions. Q5.

No separation from placebo for whole population. However, in a subgroup of participants experiencing high cough counts (at least 32.4 coughs per hour on average), all four doses tested did produce statistically significant reductions in cough frequency (-28% to -32%). On the safety front, the study demonstrated extremely good results regarding taste alteration (under 10% of patients), which is a big problem with competitor Afferent/Merck candidate MK-7264 (about 80% of patients). BLU will meet with FDA to discuss how to proceed.

BLU hopes to differentiate itself on safety. So far phase 2 results showed a favorable safety profile, but they need to work on efficacy.

Summary: 2019 PE is about 6. PT is 50% upside from current price of 3.15. P/TB should get to 0.7 � 0.8x from current level of 0.35x.

Banco PBM is the result of a merger in 2017 between Banco Popolare and Banco Popolare di Milano. 80% of branches are in northern Italy, primarily in the regions of Lombardy, Veneto, and Piedmont (which account for 40% of GDP). Has the largest market share in Lombardy (14.7%), which alone generates 20% of GDP. 

40% of bonds are set to mature in 2018, with an average cost of 280 bps (nearly 5x higher than the group�s total cost of funding). New bonds will be issued at a lower cost based on lower CDS spreads.

Current cost efficiency ratio of 70% is very high, but is going through a massive restructuring which will cut costs, close branches, and reduce headcount by 10% (which has already been agreed upon with labor unions). 

There is still more room to improve the capital ratio (CET1) thanks to available-for-sale maturities and held-to-maturity securities.

The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio is very high at 23.3%, but will improve from ongoing sale of bad debts, strong loan growth, and a better macro environment. Management expects NPL ratio to decrease to 16.1% by 2019, a target which has already been agreed upon with the ECB. This target ratio is high by US standards, but in line with Italian metrics. 

One risk to consider is growing populist movement Five Star, could move towards exiting the Euro or re-introducing the lira again (though at the moment this seems very unlikely).

EVENTS:

Perhaps the run-up to $70/share was very exaggerated, as the rise in BOOM far outpaced the movements of the price of oil, as well as other oilfield competitors (OIS, CLB). The decline in price was due to a combination of short sellers, a decline in oil prices, and the corresponding slowdown in well completion activities.

Management has said their pipeline has billion-dollar potential (3), but it's very early stage.

Also, Mallinckrodt acquired the maker of competitor OFIRMEV for $1.4B in 2014 (4). The problem is that the efficacy (i.e. up to 24-hour pain relief) is basically the same. ANJESO does cause less vomiting, but after two CRLs, was finally approved with the same black box warning regarding cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events as other drugs in this space. The US IV pain management market is $6B+, but the landscape of non-opioid options continues to grow crowded, so it's unclear if ANJESO will realize the 26% market share that physician surveys indicate it will get (1, slide 14).

PIPELINE:

Neutropenia is an abnormally low blood concentration of neutrophils (white blood cells). Chemo-induced neutropenia occurs in up to 65% of chemo patients. In 2017, current standard of care treatment G-CSF (neulasta) generated 4.5B in global sales. G-CSF drugs in the US have not faced new competition since 1991 (though biosimilars are enering the market mid-2018 to compete with neupogen, another of AMGNs blockbusters), and carry side effect risks such as high mortality rates, enlarged spleen, sickle cell disorder, and bone pain.

Plinabulin + docetaxel (CIN from docetaxel) (Study 105): Phase 3. Thus far, plinabulin has shown a competitive efficacy profile with an enhanced safety profile, such as lower incidence of bone pain. Also, it can be dosed after 1 hour after docetaxel use, as opposed to a 24-hour wait for G-CSFs such as Neulasta. See December 2019 presentation highlighting differentiation vs Neulasta (2, slides 22-29). We can assume that these improved results would also hold up against cheaper Neulasta biosimilars that have recently flooded market.'\n'
Plinabulin + TAC (CIN from TAC) (Study 106): Phase 3.'\n''\n'On 10/23/18 they announced positive top-line phase 2 data showing excellent efficacy and safety results in terms of limiting bone pain (1).'\n''\n'NSCLC - 1.8M lung cancer diagnoses globally, with 87% having NSCLC. Nearly 1/3 are in China, and BYSIs trials being backed by Chinese government is a good sign.

Plinabulin + docetaxel (NSCLC 2nd/3rd line): Phase 3 Study 103. Phase 2 data showed that plinabulin + docetaxel has better ORR than docetaxel alone (18% vs 11%). However, while cross-trial comparisons isnt ideal, the same level of improved ORR can also be obtained with ramucirumab + docetaxel vs docetaxel alone (23% vs 14%). Where plinabulin clearly differentiates itself is in the much improved safety profile. Specifically, rates of grade 3/4 neutropenia were much better in plinabulin + docetaxel vs docetaxel (7% vs 26%) compared with ramucirumab + docetaxel vs docetaxel (49% vs 39%)  (2, slide 18).'\n'

CARA,25.17,0.00,2017-12-22,0.00,"CARA Thesis: CARA is a definite long-term buy, as the FDA and the public are eagerly awaiting non-addictive opioid replacements. However, past results in pain trials have been mixed, so the upcoming catalyst could go either way. Since the real value is in pruritus (severe itch related to kidney and liver disease), it might be best to take a position now, but be prepared to buy and hold some more should the pain data readout sink the price. 

Cash: 104M, burn 12M

Catalysts: 1H18 (CR845 post-op pain phase 3 . . . 50/50 chance of success based on mixed past results in pain trials) 

Summary: With a current market cap of 400M, the payout from capturing the 12B pruritus market could be very rewarding. Phase 2 results so far have been excellent. But in the short-term, the stock could be pushed down from disappointing results in the pain trial (phase 2 results were mixed).

CARA is targeting kappa receptors in the nervous system, in the hopes of coming up with a non-addictive opioid replacement (NKTR-181 is working on the same problem, but targeting mu receptors).

IV CR845 (pruritus CKD-HD): Phase 3 safety study. Breakthrough designation. Non-addictive, limited entry into central nervous system (CNS). 

Pruritus is a serious itching condition directly related to kidney disease. 60-70% of hemodialysis patients suffer from it. Can lead to excoriations of the skin in some cases. 456K dialysis patients in US. 12.2M non-dialysis patients with CKD in US, 32% of which treated for pruritus. No FDA approved therapies. Pruritus market size expected to be 12B by 2021. CEO is no record saying he expects income from pruritus treatments to be higher than from pain treatments.

Primary and secondary phase 2 endpoints met with statistical significance. With regards to at least a 3-point improvement in itch score, 29% of placebo vs 64% CR845. With regards to at least a 4-pt improvement, 24% placebo vs 51% CR845. Well-tolerated, with minor side effects such as dizziness and headaches.   

IV CR845 (pruritus CKD-HD): Phase 2.

Oral CR845 (pruritus CKD-HD): Phase 1.

Oral CR845 (pruritus CKD III-IV): Phase 1.

IV CR845 (post-op pain): Phase 3. Goal is to improve patient outcomes, decrease length of hospital stay, and reduce costs. Traditional post-op pain treatments cause respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, and abuse. Phase 2 data was good and showed clinical response, but missed statistical significance with p=0.068 when CR845 was administered pre-op, and the placebo was administered post-op. Did see a meaningful reduction in post-op nausea and vomiting.  

Oral CR845 (chronic pain OA): Phase 2b complete. Results show efficacy but did not meet statistical significance with NRS pain score for hip and knee arm. Hip arm did meet statistical significance. 86% of AEs (dizziness, constipation) occurred within first 4 weeks of titration and resolved themselves without treatment. Compares favorably to other medications in this setting. Efficacy results compare favorably to oxycodone CR and two other common pain treatments, but similar results to naproxen and celecoxib. CARA plans on increasing tablet strength from current 5mg to between 5-10mg, which is still far below 30mg doses of other pain meds.",,3,6,17.15,0.00,0,0,0,0.00

If SGMOs results hold up, it looks like they have found a cure.

Some past SA articles point out that their quadrupling to $40/share since mid-2016 was not supported by a marked improvement in the financials. They attribute the unjustified rise to a succession of several slight earnings beats, culminating with the inflow of institutional investors once it was announced in October 2018 that CHEF would join the small cap index.

Proved oil and natural gas reserves in the Utica Shale as of December 31, 2017 were approximately 480 million boe (72% natural gas, 23% natural gas liquids and 5% oil).

SUMMARY:

EVENTS:

4/4/18: -40% on 4Q17 beat. The large decline in sales growth guidance, coupled with two analyst downgrades, caused the plunge. The earnings call focused on redirecting salesforce resources, as management has realized that they are spending too much time and money acquiring new customers that do not expand their business with CLDR over time. Management instead wants to focus on the �land and expand� sales targets, with customers that end up spending more and more with CLDR over time. This would imply that perhaps the target market for CLDR is not the entire Global 8000 list, but a smaller subset of it. 

Also, management says being cashflow positive will not occur until 1QFY20 (but will be cashflow positive for the entire FY20).

From February to June 2019, the CEO has purchased $80M worth of shares at prices ranging from the mid $40s to high $30s. Another thing to like is that they are the lowest cost operator in this space, and can be cashflow neutral at $45/Bbl WTI (2). They do have about 5.4B in net debt and plan on reducing it to $5B by year end. With no balloon payment due until 2022 ($1.6B), cash is not an immediate concern. But sentiment seems to be against their decision on June 3 to initiate a $0.05/share quarterly dividend (starting 11/21/19, about $75M/yr) and a $1B share buyback plan (through 2020). This money could be better spent on debt reduction, which would seem the safer thing to do in case WTI drops below $45. Its also worth mentioning that while they hedge future gas production, they dont hedge future oil production, which seems a risky strategy.

Excitement over new lead candidate Rubraca led the stocks recovery to $100/share in 2017 after the termination of previous lead candidate rociletinib caused the stock to crash in late 2015. But since hitting $100/share, expectations have come down quite a bit. The market for 2nd and 3rd line ovarian and prostate cancer treatment is crowded with similar new drugs from Merck, AstraZeneca, GSK, and Pfizer. Additionally, the number of women that have chosen to receive maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer is much lower than expected. As of 1Q20, annualized Rubraca sales were $172M and growing only 8% qoq, so getting close to blockbuster status seems unlikely.

PIPELINE:

Emricasan (liver transplant with fibrosis/cirrhosis): Phase 2 POLT-HCV-SVR complete. Orphan drug. Dosage was 25mg twice-daily for 2 years. Announced top-line results on 4/4/18. A difference of 15% from placebo was defined as success. Although the study missed the primary endpoint among the entire trial population, the response rate among the F3, F4, F5 subgroup (patients with advanced fibrosis and early cirrhosis) supports further evaluation. Also, it was very unexpected (and still unexplained) to see a 100% response rate (3/3) in the placebo group for F6, given how far along with fibrosis these patients are. Without these 3 anomalies, the overall trial would have met its endpoint.

Overall population: 77% (24/31) vs 75% (15/20), 2.4% difference, p=0.842
F2*: 83% (5/6) vs 100% (5/5), -17% difference, p=1.0

F6*: 0% (0/5) vs 100% (3/3), -100% difference, p=0.018

*prespecified subgroup

Additionally, in patients with the potential to continue worsening (those less than F6 at baseline), only 8% (2/26) on emricasan vs 29% (5/17) placebo showed an increase in fibrosis score at 2 years, a 22% difference.

Consistent with the previous clinical trials, emricasan was well-tolerated, and the safety profile was similar to the placebo group. 

Emricasan (NASH w/cirrhosis): Phase 2 ENCORE-PH. Announced top-line results on 12/6/18.

Emricasan (NASH w/fibrosis): Phase 2 ENCORE-NF. Prevalence in US and EU is 15M (1).

The bullish outlook for COG from the SA article was based on recent cold spells that have depleted natural gas reserves, and the fact that they have two long-term contracts to supply natural gas directly to power plants that start up during the summer of 2018. Management said on the 2Q18 call that if their company dealt with a commodity other than natural gas, their stock would be a lot higher (indicating how negative the sentiment is towards gas right now). The forward PE of 14 isnt low in absolute terms, but at current gas prices management thinks their 2019 capital and production plan can grow EPS at 60%. Target weight 0.75%. Actual weight 0.24%.

EVENTS:'\n''\n''\n'12/10/19 BO: -31%. 3QFY20. SSS plunged to -8% due to the impact of underwriting adjustments we consider prudent and unprecedented market dynamics within our consumer electronics category. During the third quarter, we began to see deteriorating performance of certain segments of the portfolio, primarily driven by new customers and sales from online applicants. We made the necessary adjustments to maintain our credit spread of approximately 1,000 basis points, which negatively impacted same store sales by approximately 4% to 5%. Compounding the impact to third quarter retail sales was a combination of significant price deflation for premium large screen televisions, which negatively affected average selling prices, and an increase in production of large screen televisions by second- and third-tier manufacturers, which made cash purchases of large screen televisions more accessible to our core customer and negatively impacted units. These factors in the consumer electronics category further impacted same store sales by approximately 3% to 4% during the quarter.

Sales growth target is +8-10% per year, so it seems fairly priced.

6/7/18: +20%. 1Q18 saw a solid beat, with continued improvement in comps and 60-day delinquency rates. April was the first month of positive SSS in over 2 years. 

4/5/18: -23%. 4Q17. The 60-day delinquency rate declined 80bps, the second consecutive quarter of YOY decline. The decrease in sales was due to the transition of our lease-to-own partner, tightened credit policies, and general consumer softness along the Mexico border.

The FDA has approved a pediatric version from Jacobus Pharma (Ruzurgi), which used to offer an almost identical version of the drug for free under a compassionate use program. Now that it is approved for ages 6-17, doctors are free to prescribe it off-label for adults. Insurance companies do not always cover off-lable uses, but given the $375K/yr cost of Firdapse, and the fact that Ruzurgi was used for years as an effective treatment, it seems likely it will be covered for off-lable use. A bit too much uncertainty regarding the pending lawsuit Firdapse has brought against the FDA over its loss of total exclusivity for LEMS patients (CPRX has Orphan status for adult LEMS while Jacobus has Orphan status for pediatric LEMS). While I agree with CPRXs argument, the idea of the FDA being forced to retract a prior approval for a lower cost drug seems far-fetched given the political environment over the high cost of drugs.

CPRX has received Orphan Drug designation, so there will likely be an immediate legal challenge against the approval for Jacobus (which interestingly enough also has Orphan status for the pediatric indication). Now that Ruzurgi is approved for children, doctors are free to prescribe it off-label for adults. Its up to insurance companies to cover it off-label, but the fact that firdapse costs 375K/patient would likely be a reason for insurance companies to gladly cover it off-label. Ruzurgi has never been officially studied in adult patients but for years it had been effective at treating LEMS and was offered under a compassionate use program costing a few hundred dollars. Jacobus has said that quote: obviously, it will be less than what they are chargin. The main legal question seems to be: Can the pediatric and adult markets really be considered separate Orphan markets if doctors are able to legally prescribe drugs for off-label use?

It is most commonly diagnosed in people over 40, and approximately 50% of patients also develop cancer (typically NSCLC). FIRDAPSE only approved evidence-based safe effective therapy for adults.  Off-label therapies with limited efficacy and difficult to obtain reimbursement. Commercialized in EU since 2010. 2017 EU sales were 19M. Received RTF letter in February 2016 for two issues that required an additional phase 3 trial. Announced positive results from the additional phase 3 trial on 11/27/17, with co-primary endpoints and the secondary endpoint all achieving statistical and clinical significance. Also, the tolerability profile was similar to the previous phase 3.

Firdapse (CMS): Awaiting NDA. Phase 3 missed primary endpoint on 10/30. Orphan designation. CMS is an ultra-rare gene disorder (24 possible genes) that causes muscle weakness, and affects only 3/1M globally. Currently no FDA-approved treatment.

Firdapse (MuSK-MG): Phase 3. Orphan designation. MuSK-MG is an autoimmune disorder that affects the muscles, and is found in 2-7/10K globally.

The results demonstrate long-term clinical benefit as shown by an increase in eliciting dose (ED), which may decrease the chance of reacting to an accidental peanut exposure. After three years, 75.9% (107/141) of patients had increased their ED from baseline, and 51.8% (73/141) of patients reached an ED of at least 1,000 mg peanut protein by year three.

Viaskin Peanut (peanut allergy, ages 4-11): 8/5/20 PDUFA date. Breakthrough, Fast Track. In October 2017, it dropped from 45 to 20 on reported trial failure due to missing statistical significance, but results clearly showed treatment benefits with no safety issues. Response rate was statistically significant (35% vs 14% placebo, p=.00001), but 15% lower bound of the 95% CI proposed in the SAP submitted to FDA was not reached. 1.1% dropout due to TEAEs, but favorable tolerability. Results show that Viaskin Peanut is less efficacious than AIMTs treatment but with a better safety profile. However, for both treatments, its not clear what the long-term durability of response is (do they need to be taken forever?), so I dont see either as being a sure-fire commercial success.
 
Viaskin Peanut (peanut allergy, ages 1-3): Phase 3 initiated Aug 2017.

Viaskin Peanut (peanut allergy, adolescents and adults): Phase 2. Allergy treatments seem to be less effective once the immune system has developed past childhood, so I would assign zero value to this age group.

Viaskin Milk (cows milk protein allergy, ages 2-17): Phase 2 MILES complete. Fast Track. On 2/26/18 announced preliminary results from Phase 2 MILES study (2). Following analyses of the data, the 300 g dose was identified as the most effective tested dose for children. The most commonly reported adverse events were mild and moderate application site reactions. While the efficacy is better vs placebo, its concerning that the responder rates for overall population and children were higher in the 300 microgram cohort compared with 500 microgram cohort.

Its a topical anticholinergic designed to block sweat production. Has pharmaceutical composition and methods of use patents that expire in 2033.

Botox and surgery are often used to treat, as are these off-label anticholinergic treatments:

Glycopyrrolate: $63.72/1mg (60 tablets)
Oxybutynin: $44.16/1mg
Benztropine: $25.54/1mg
Propantheline: $50.00/1mg

6/1/16: Excellent phase 3 data showed patients began to see an improvement in sweating severity compared to vehicle, as measured by ASDD, at week 1 in ATMOS-1 (22.9% vs. 5.3%) and ATMOS-2 (29.0% vs. 4.2%), that continued through the completion of the 4-week treatment period.
 
GT was generally well-tolerated, with side effects that were primarily mild to moderate in severity. Dry mouth, dilated pupil, blurred vision, urinary hesitation and dry eye are well-known, reversible side effects of anticholinergic agents.

Olumacostat glasaretil (acne sebum production): DISCONTINUED. Two Phase 3 complete. Topical acc inhibitor. Announced on 3/5/18 that both CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2 did not meet co-primary endpoints and program will likely be discontinued.

AD is considered the most common, severe, and long-lasting type of eczema. Moderate to severe AD affects 7M in US. The psoriasis market (2017 sales of 8B) provides an analog for the AD market, which is at only 1B in sales. 

Competitors include Leo Pharma, which on 7/1/16 entered into a licensing deal with AZN, paying up to 1B for its IL-13 antibody inhibitor tralokinumab that also targets AD. Sanofi and Regeneron also began commercializing injectable dupixent in 2017, initially for AD but eventually for asthma and other indications. Peak sales estimates are for 4B+ (Bernsteins), with the dupixent costing $38K/yr.

Phase 2 data showed dose-dependent efficacy, and suggested an opportunity to improve efficacy by dosing higher and longer, and convenience by dosing less frequently.

8/8/17: -13% on news that DERM obtained exclusive worldwide rights from Roche, paying up to 1.4B plus royalties, to develop and commercialize lebrikizumab for AD and all other indications except lung diseases. The market does not like the deal because of Roches lack of success with IL-13 for treating asthma. Also, several IL-13 inhibitors have had a checkered clinical history.

DERM will make an initial payment of 80M, payments totaling 55M in 2018, 40M upon entering phase 3, up to 210M upon achievement of regulatory and first commercial sales milestones, up to 1.025B upon achievement of certain net sales milestones, and high single-digit to high-teen royalties.

Their non-fiction content is very cheap to produce ($450K/hr) compared with scripted content such as Game of Thrones ($5M/hr).

Slowly, the cable providers are responding to the accelerating cord cutting going on. The US is the only country in the world that does not offer a cheap and basic TV bundle that does not involve sports. DISCA CEO predicts that 2018 will finally be the year cable companies acknowledge that if they offer a cheaper bundle with good programming but no sports, they will keep some customers that otherwise would not sign up for cable. A content provider like DISCA will benefit from this inevitable move. Also, DISCA currently not offered on SlingTV, Hulu, and YouTubeTV. Management thinks they eventually will be.

DISCA has 3B subscribers worldwide in over 220 countries. The majority of SNIs content has not been exposed to international markets, and so should benefit from DISCAs worldwide distribution.

Their shift-to-digital strategy revolves around 3 areas: 1) ad-supported digital (GOTV apps), 2) paid direct-to-consumer subscription video, 3) mobile first short and mid-form content.

At first this technology will be used to slowly replace traditional UPC barcodes, as items can be checked out much faster with Digimarc Barcode (and dont require extra human labor to apply). But the real opportunity here is in recycling plastics. Early tests have shown that items imprinted with the Digimarc Barcode can be more accurately sorted for recycling compared with the infra-red scanners that are currently used (one manufacturer called its ability to sort food vs non-food plastics as game-changing given that infra-red scanncers cannot do this).

Nice earnings beat but no change to guidance (they usually only update guidance twice per year but they did say on the call that they were still very comfortable with previous guidance). Rates for both specialized and flatbed segments, as well as revs/tractor, were up a bit. I think the reason why its down is because we still dont see a tremendous improvement in adj EBITDA margin.

They saw organic revs growth of +18%, driven by a continued increase in rates in both the flatbed and specialized shipping segments. Acquisition adjusted net income of 2.7M. The driver retention program seems to be working, as they are seeing improved retention rates vs the industry. Full-year guidance maintained. The concern seems to be that they arent making much money. Management said their aggressive M&amp;A strategy will be put on hold for several months while they focus on the integration of the recent acquisitions.'\n''\n'8/9/18: +5%. 2Q18 beat expectations, and full year guidance was raised. The catalyst has been a rise in shipping rates across all segments. They also remain committed to a focused M&amp;A strategy, having closed two recent acquisitions. There are a few reasons why the stock jump wasnt higher even though guidance was raised. The organic revs growth came from the rise in shipping rates, which tends to be higher during 2Q and 3Q. Driver wages were up 11%, and management has initiated a pilot program in the Northwest to simplify driver pay and try to attract more drivers (so far its a great success), which would hopefully lower costs. Also, while shipping rates are still going up, the rate of rate increases is slowing. On the plus side, they have seen no impact from tariffs on supply chains, and they are much more exposed to the domestic steel industry vs imported steel.'\n''\n'5/8/18: +7%. 1Q18 was a solid beat on both top and bottom line. Shipping rates continue to increase, and management feels confident the previous 2018 guidance will be met or exceeded. Guidance will be updated during the 2Q18 conference call after the recent acquisitions have closed. Several insiders are interested in purchasing stock once the window to do so opens. Things are moving in the right direction.

3/16/18: 4Q17 revs 257M, +71% YOY (due to acquisitions). Net income 39M, EPS 0.62. Adjusted EBITDA 23M, +51%. Completed 7 acquisitions during 2017. Spot pricing for flatbed trucking has been rising, and contract rates tend to lag about 3-6 months, so this segment should definitely improve. But management is not yet ready to say that rates for specialized segment are improving across the board. They just arent seeing a full recovery from 2015 demand in terms of wind farms, oil patches, etc. Since specialized segment makes up 57% of revs vs 43% flatbed, we arent seeing more organic growth. But about 90% of revs is re-priced every year, so if rates continue to rise they arent locked in to low-paying contracts.

3/27/18: No change on FDA approval of G6 iCGM system for determining blood glucose levels in children age 2 to adults. Classifies this new type of device in class II (as opposed to more burdensome class III) and subjects it to certain criteria called special controls. This enables app developers to bring their product to market in the least burdensome manner possible.

1Q18 guidance: revs will be about 20% of yearly total. Seasonally 1Q is always lower but perhaps market does not like the sharp drop in sequential growth.

Their HIFU device is the global leader in therapeutic ultrasound, able to treat prostate cancer effectively by targeting tumor cells while doing minimal damage to neighboring healthy cells. This seems like something that should have great commercial success, but after years of being available around the world (ex-US), annual sales are still only 40M, and growing very little. But there is no investor presentation giving thoughts on peak sales, and no commentary on why international sales aren't growing faster (difficulty obtaining insurance coverage, resistance from radiologists to use a new technology that competes with radiation treatment, etc.).

There is a comment that according to Bloomberg, Purdue Pharma will be responsible for 60% of the opioid liability while ENDP will shoulder 20%. In Oklahoma then, (270M/0.6) = 450M total opioid liability. ENDPs share is then 0.2 * 450M = 90M. If you multiply this by 50 states, thats still 4.5B.

EROS,0.00,0.00,2020-06-29,2.96,"6/29/20 EROS QR: EROS is the Netflix of India, and there are some things that make this seem very attractive. They have almost 30M paying subscribers, which is about double what Netflix and Amazon each have in India. They have a very large library of content covering all the major languages spoken in India, and are looking to expand their penetration into China, where Indian films are somewhat popular and are viewed more favorably by the Chinese government than Western films. The growth potential between these two countries is enormous. But the super low stock price shows that investors are still concerned by the financial reporting fraud allegations that arose a few years ago. This, along with the high debt load, makes this too risky for anything other than a speculative position.

ESPR,86.00,86.00,2018-05-21,42.14,"ESPR QR: Cash 286M, burn 60M. ESPR is developing bempedoic acid to complement (for now) existing LDL-C treatments (not compete with them). A class of drug called statins has been very successful at lowering cholesterol (i.e. lipitor sales 13.7B), but many patients are unable to use them long-term due to serious cardiovascular and muscular side effects. Whats been missing from the market is a non-statin drug that can match the efficacy of 45-50% reduction that you get with statins. PCSK9 inhibitors such as repatha and praluent have shown that level of efficacy, but at 14K/yr, their high cost has really dampened sales (which is why repathas price was cut by 60% in October 2018). ESPR dropped 40% on 5/2/18 from 13 patient deaths (in a treatment group of 1,487), but 52-week data released on 10/29/18 showed a great safety profile and laid to rest any lingering safety concern. The reason the&nbsp;stock did not surge is because the cholesterol-lowering landscape continues to get more crowded, and its not clear ESPR will have multi-blockbuster sales. AMRN is also awaiting approval for a fish-oil drug that has been selling for 30 years in Japan, works very well, and has no side effects (AMRNs market cap increased 6-fold to 6B in September 2018 on good trial results).

PIPELINE: Management said on the 8/27/18 call that bempedoic acid will not be priced anywhere near PCSK9 drugs such as repatha and praluent.

BEMPEDOIC ACID (lowering elevated LDL-C): Phase 3 STUDY 1 (52 weeks) complete. Once daily oral pill. The 2,230-subject trial met the primary endpoint of safety and tolerability and the key efficacy endpoint of lowering LDL-C of an additional 20% at week 12 (p&lt;0.001). Patients also experienced a 22% reduction in an inflammation biomarker called CRP. The incidence of AEs were similar between treatment (78.5%) and placebo (78.7%), as were the rate of SAEs (14.5% vs 14%). Discontinuation due to AEs was 10.9% vs 7.1%. There were 13 deaths in the treatment group vs 2 in the control group. However, an independent panel has determined that the deaths were not related to the treatment, and management has provided extensive follow-up commentary on the patients. 

Of the 13 deaths, 5 were for cardiovascular issues. The control group only had 1 death from cardiovascular issues. Given that the study was a 2:1 randomized trial, the 5:1 ratio vs the 4:2 expected ratio was only an imbalance of 1 patient. Also, patients were required to have prior cardiovascular issues in order to participate in the trial, and having prior cardiovascular issues is the best predictor of future cardiovascular issues. And 3 out of 5 occurrences were within 61 days of starting treatment. This was simply not seen at all in phase 2.

5 of the deaths were due to cancer. Of these, 4 were for lung cancer, and all patients had been smokers that were undiagnosed. One patient was on the treatment for only 3 days before being diagnosed with lung cancer. There is no biological explanation for this drug causing lung cancer. 

The remaining 3 deaths were in the other category.

BEMPEDOIC ACID (CVD risk reduction): Phase 3 STUDY 2. Once daily oral pill. Announced positive 52-week results on 10/29/18. The safety profile was excellent, and puts to rest any concern regarding the previous patient deaths. But the efficacy results, while good, were not incredible (20% LDL-C reduction over statins, while repatha and praluent have shown upwards of 50%)  (3).

BEMPEDOIC ACID + EZETIMIBE COMBO (lowering elevated LDL-C): Phase 3 STUDY 3. Once daily oral pill. '\n''\n'Positive top-line results reported on 8/27/18.

At week 12, 23% of treatment group showed a drop in bad cholesterol vs 1% placebo (p&lt;0.001). At week 24, 26% vs 2% for LDL-C reduction. Patients in treatment group saw a 25% reduction in C-reactive protein, an inflammation biomarker, vs 3% placebo (p&lt;0.001). AE and SAE rates were indistinguishable between treatment and placebo groups, and no deaths were reported.

The PFS results (primary endpoint) were clinically meaningful and statistically significant, but the OS analysis showed a favorable trend that was not statistically significant. In April 2018, a NEJM article (2) published results from the opdivo + yervoy&nbsp;vs sunitinib&nbsp;phase 3 Checkmate214 trial (the initial results had previously been announced in September 2017). While its not completely precise to make cross-trial comparisons, BMYs opdivo + yervoy combo showed better results vs sunitinib compared with cabometyx across the board: ORR (42% vs 20%), median&nbsp;PFS ( 11.6 months vs 8.6 months), etc. The opdivo + yervoy combo was approved by the FDA in April 2018 as a 1st line treatment for RCC, and it will likely displace cabometyx as the standard of care.  '\n'SAFETY: The opdivo + yervoy combo has a slight advantage. The phase 2 cabosun cabometyx trial saw a 68% grade 3 or 4 AE rate and a 21% discontinuation rate.

The 50 mg arm also met all three key secondary endpoints (p &lt; 0.01). The profile of pain intensity over time demonstrated that IV tramadol 50 mg achieved statistically significant improvement in pain reduction as early as  hour (the first assessment timepoint) after dosing. The IV tramadol 25 mg treatment arm generally displayed intermediate results that fell between the 50 mg and the placebo arms, with a dose response observed across each of the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints.

US Orphan, Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy. EU PUMA designation. Cisplatin, the penicillin of cancer, is used to treat pediatric tumors but causes irreversible high-frequency hearing loss (ototoxicity) in 60% of children. FENC is developing PEDMARK for prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity in children with cancer. '\n''\n'No approved treatments. Cochlear implants cost $60K and provide only minimally better hearing (1).

SUMMARY: Along with general retail headwinds of overcapacity and Amazon, FL faces a growing threat from brands such as Nike growing their own direct-to-consumer channel. This is something Nike management has been talking about on the calls, and a recent SA article showed that as FL YOY sales drop, Nike YOY sales go up. Also, maybe the Jordan brand has finally run its course and can't command the extremely high prices that it has for the past 30 years.

Everyday 4M unique visitors visit their hundreds of media properties, with 1M registering. Their point of contact with the visitor is through stories such as 7 ways to pay off your mortgage faster. Once this data is collected, they then can use it to send targeted ads to the consumer, such as a Become an Uber driver ad for someone who owns a car and lives in a big city.

PIPELINE:

BELAPECTIN (NASH cirrhosis): Phase 3 initiated 3Q18. After 3,000 doses, no recorded safety issues for liver NASH treatment. This will be a 35-40B market by 2025.  

Varices are dilated blood vessels in the esophagus or stomach caused by portal hypertension. 50% of the study participants did not have varices, which is the same percentage found in the general patient population. Though the study missed on the primary endpoint, if only patients without varices had been included, it would have been a resounding success. Percent responders with HPVG (Hepatic Venous Pressure Gradient) reduction from baseline of &gt;= 2mm Hg was 44% vs 15% placebo, with p=0.02. Percent responders with HPVG reduction from baseline of &gt;= 20% was 40% vs 15% placebo, with p=0.03. Its clear that varices have a wide effect on the measurement of HPVG. Management has indicated that measurement in the non-varices population could be considered a primary endpoint in a phase 3 study. 

BELAPECTIN (advanced fibrosis): Phase 2.

BELAPECTIN (lung, kidney, cardiovascular fibrosis): Preclinical.

BELAPECTIN + Yervoy (melanoma): Phase 1.

BELAPECTIN + Keytruda (pembrolizumab) (melanoma + head/neck cancer): Phase 1 complete. '\n''\n'Reported successful phase 1b results on 9/20/18. ORR of GR-MD-02+keytruda was 50% vs 33% for keytruda alone. Trial will be expanded to include more patients.'\n''\n'ORR of 5/8 patients (63%) very encouraging and compares favorably with known response rate of Keytruda alone (ORR 33%). Given that GR-MD-02 is dose-dependent, it would only take a 60% correlation with an increased dose to get ORR to 100%. Assuming only a 30% correlation would given them an ORR of 80%, which would put them on par with some of the more robust CAR-T therapies in the world.

Rates have gone up a bit, but still well below 2013 pre-crash levels, and until they go up more, they will not make much money. Management feels optimistic that rates will go up because of increasing LPG production and consumption, a very low orderbook, and an ageing global fleet.

Tanker markets are typically stronger in the winter months as a result of increased oil consumption in the northern hemisphere, but weaker in the summer months as a result of lower oil consumption in the northern hemisphere and refinery maintenance. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and supplies of certain commodities. As a result, our revenues may be stronger in fiscal quarters ended December 31 and March 31 and relatively weaker during the fiscal quarters ended June 30 and September 30, as was the case in each of the last five fiscal years.'\n''\n'SUMMARY: Market leader in LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) shipping segment for small size vessels.

The third quarter of the year usually has a soft element due to seasonal factors but in addition this quarter market conditions in Asia were less favorable than usual as we witnessed some charterers not renewing time charter vessels in direct continuation thus leaving more than usual vessels to operate in the spot market. This impacted our revenues. The market in Asia has now corrected itself and time charter fixing has picked up, as is evident from the eleven new time charters we have concluded since our last earnings report. The most important aspect of our segment, however, is that the fundamentals, that is increasing LPG production and consumption, a very low orderbook, and an ageing global fleet, continue to drive our market.

12/11/17: Down 25% over a few days following release of phase 3 GBT-440 data in SCD. Two patient deaths reported but they are unrelated to the treatment. BLU also released positive update on SCD investigation with evidence suggesting clinical cure with anti-sickling globin above 30% (from a comment on SA, only 2/3 patients so small sample). Improvement has extended to 35 months. SA author says BLUs lentiglobin gene therapy shows more efficacy in beta-thalassemia rather than SCD, so shouldnt affect voxelotor. But his full explanation requires a subscription to view.

PIPELINE:

Voxelotor peak sales estimate 2B to 3B (SeekingAlpha) for SCD market. High costs associated with SCD (200K/yr for an adult) support premium pricing for drug. Sickle cell disease affects 100K Americans.

Voxelotor is a novel drug in its own class (elotor or oxygen affinity modulator), increases oxygen binding capacity of blood protein hemoglobin to prevent sickling crisis. SA author (Integrated BioSci Investing) says since voxelotor and CRSPs CTX-001 use different mechanisms of action, CTX-001 is likely to complement voxelotor rather than take the market away from them.

GBT-440 (Voxelotor) (sickle cell disease): Phase 3 HOPE Part A trial will continue as planned. Also includes pediatric patients. No tolerability issues thus far. Two patient deaths but unrelated to treatment.'\n''\n'Announced very good results on 6/27/18. They met the primary endpoint, with 58% of patients taking the 1500 mg dose (p&lt;0.0001) and 38% of patients taking the 900 mg dose (p=0.0021) achieved a greater than 1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin at 12 weeks versus 9% of patients taking placebo. This compares favorably to the hemoglobin increase assumption agreed to with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the HOPE Study protocol of a 35% response. There were numerically fewer vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) episodes in both voxelotor groups than in the placebo group, which as anticipated did not reach statistical significance due to limited patient follow-up. The patient reported outcomes (PRO) data were difficult to interpret due to low baseline symptom scores and high inter-subject and intra-subject variability. Given this, GBT does not plan to utilize the PRO as a key secondary endpoint. The company met with FDA on June 25 and Is in Discussions on Potential Accelerated Approval Based on Hemolytic Anemia Efficacy as Assessed by Primary Endpoint.'\n''\n'The drop on these good phase 3 results is likely for two reasons: '\n''\n'1) They have temporarily paused enrollment at 254 patients (154 from Part A, plus an additional 100), even though management previously said they would enroll 400. Management explained that this is simply due to a techical issue, given that if they continue to enroll patients, they will be violating FDA protocol. There were no new safety issues reported.'\n''\n'2) The full data was not presented. While it's good that there were fewer VOC episodes, they are unable to give an exact rate at this time, not allowing investors to do a direct comparison with other drugs. Also, they don't have the PRO data, but this is not such a concern. SCD causes immense pain in patients, but a lack of pain reduction is not necessarily an indication that the drug is not working. GBT has focused on pharmacokinetic indicators such as hemoglobin levels (and ultimately organ preservation), not quality of life indicators such as pain reduction. Management is confident that the FDA will grant accelerated approval based on great pharmacokinetic indicators, since pain is a symptom of SCD, but not an underlying cause of it. Management would not say if they have enough VOC data to give to the FDA should it be required for accelerated approval.'\n'
GBT-440 (Voxelotor) (hypoxemia in patients with pulmonary fibrosis)'\n''\n'Inclacumab (VOC): Pre-clinical. Licensed from Roche on 8/23/18 for 2M upfront, 125M in milestones, and tiered royalties on net sales. Roche discontinued inclacumab trials after phase 2 in coronary artery. I havent found any press release explaining why, but since safety was not an issue, Im guessing the efficacy was questionable, which is why GBT paid so little probably. If GBT finds a way to make it work for sickle cell disease, it would complement their drug voxelotor very nicely.'\n''\n'Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is the most common clinical manifestation of SCD. It occurs when the microcirculation is obstructed by sickled RBCs, causing ischemic injury to the organ supplied and resultant pain. Approximately half of individuals with SCD experience VOC. Pain crises begin suddenly and may last several hours to several days. The pain can affect any body part but often involves the abdomen, bones, joints and soft tissue.1 VOC result in a decrease in quality of life2 and an increase in the risk of death.3",,3,6,48.77,44.78,0,0,0,0.70

Our casinos in Laughlin and Rocky Gap typically experience higher revenues during summer months with increased visitation and may be adversely impacted by inclement weather during winter months. Our Montana distributed gaming operations also typically experience higher revenues during the summer due to the inclement weather in other seasons. While other factors like the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment levels, market competition and the diversification of our business may either offset or magnify seasonal effects, some seasonality is likely to continue, which could result in significant fluctuation in our quarterly operating results.

PIPELINE:

Imetelstat (high-risk myelofibrosis (MF) refractory to JAK inhibitor): Phase 2 IMbark. 3K/yr diagnosed in US, 13K in US living with disease, 70% of patients have high/intermediate-2 risk disease.

In the US/EU, INCYs Jakafi (ruxolitinib) is the only approved treatment for MF. Jakafi is an oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor that is on track for 1.3B in sales for 2018, with management guiding for 2.5-3B by 2027. Patients stay on it as long as its tolerated, but after 3 years, the discontinuation rate is 50%, and after 5 years, the discontinuation rate is 75% (due to suboptimal response or loss of therapeutic effect). After discontinuation of Jakafi, the median OS is 7-16 months (as of January 2018, GERN had not reached median OS at 19 months). There is much debate, however, as to whether GERNs patient pool was generally healthier than INCYs, as GERN required a minimum platelet count of 75K to participate, whereas INCYs median platelet count was below this. There are no approved MF treatments for patients that are refractory to Jakafi.

GERN is testing a dose of 9.4 mg/kg every 3 weeks (the 4.7 mg/kg arm was deemed to be ineffective). The original co-primary endpoints were spleen size response rate and total symptom response rate. Median OS was a secondary endpoint. However, in October 2016, it was determined that the spleen response rate at 12 weeks was not adequate compared with prior JAK inhibitor trials, and so the protocol was amended to allow for median OS to become the primary endpoint. 

Safety profile generally consistent with other drugs in this space.

Imetelstat (transfusion dependent patients with low/mid-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) refractory to treatment with an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA)): Phase 2/3. Fast Track. 16K/yr diagnosed in US, 60K in US living with MDS, 70% have low-risk disease. Chronic anemia is the predominant clinical problem, so many patients become dependent on red blood cell transfusions up to every week, which is very burdensome and can lead to iron overload. 

The first line of treatment is with ESAs, which give an improvement in anemia in 50% of patients. Of the patients that then need red blood cell transfusions, 5-20% have a cytogenetic abnormality called deletion 5q. When treated with CELGs Revlimid (lenalidomide), about 67% achieve at least 8 weeks of red blood cell transfusion independence (RBC-TI). Revlimid is expected to have sales of 9.4B in 2018. 

However, of the 80-95% that are non-deletion 5q, only 27% achieve at least 8 weeks of RBC-TI.  (Note: Revlimid is not approved in US/EU for non-deletion 5q patients). Another type of treatment for non-del 5q patients are hypomethylating agents (HMA) such as azacytidine, but only 17% achieve at least 8 weeks of RBC-TI. 

Thus far, preliminary data has shown that when treated with imetelstat, 38% (n=12/32) of all treated achieve at least 8weeks of RBC-TI. And among those nave to revlimid and HMAs, and that are non-del 5q, 54% (n=7/13) achieve at least 8 weeks of RBC-TI.

1/4/18: GNW and Oceanside reiterate commitment to deal, and say that talks with a third party to protect US consumer info are going well. Deal has been submitted to CFIUS three times, as companies hope to avoid the �no Chinese takeover deals� mantra of the Trump administration.

Intrinsic value has since rise at least $1B ($2/share), based on SA author calculation of GNW�s equity stakes in Canadian and Australian mortgage firms.

PEGPH20: Oncology operations discontinued November 2019. 1B opportunity in pancreatic cancer alone (management estimate). Estimated annual HA-high patients per tumor type:

Gall bladder: 7K
Gastric: 22K
Pancreas: 22K
Lung: 87K 

Helps anti-cancer drugs better penetrate the tumor environment in cancers where hyaluronic acid (HA) is present in higher levels. Removal of HA from the tumor results in expansion of previously constricted blood vessels, potentially increasing access of activated immune cells and factors in the blood.

PEGPH20 + Abraxane + gemcitabine (pancreatic cancer): Phase 3 HALO-301. 65K diagnosed each year. 55K will die within 12 months. 25K estimated high-HA patients. High levels of HA associated with poor survival.

Hylenex (adjuvant for fluid delivery and absorption of other injected drugs): Approved in US. Could do 200M in 2018.

Enhanze + Herceptin (breast cancer): Approved in EU and outside US with Roche. 

Enhanze + MabThera (multiple blood cancers): Approved in EU and outside US with Roche.

Enhanze + Rituxan Hycela (multiple blood cancers): Approved in US with Roche. 

Enhanze + Hyqvia (primary immunodeficiency): Approved in EU, US with Baxalta.

Enhanze + Darzalex (amyloidosis, myeloma): 4 phase 3 trials complete with Janssen.

Several phase 1 trials.

2/20/18: 4Q17 revs 190M, +386% YOY. EPS 0.85.

1/16/17: Dropped 20% on unexpectedly poor trial results. Trial was being conducted by an outside agency, SWOG, which was testing whether combining PEGPH20 with Folfirinox (FFOX), a recently developed chemo agent that has shown good OS in pancreatic cancer, would yield better results than FFOX alone. 

However, the trial did not screen for patients with high levels of HA, which is the cohort that PEGPH20 targets. Also, the OS in the control arm was 15.1 months, the longest ever reported for any FFOX trials. And data will now be analyzed to take into account HA levels. It was reported that adding PEGPH20 caused increased toxicity (has had issues with thromboembolic events in the past, but trial amendments have resolved the issue).  

Around 40% of pancreatic cancer patients are HA-high, and earlier data targeting these patients has been excellent. Median PFS improved by 91% (8.6 months vs 4.5 months) and median OS by 50% (11.7 months vs 7.8 months).

These results should not have been a surprise, as this paragraph from HALOs 3/30/17 press release indicates that the efficacy would likely not be there for this trial:

During a planned early futility analysis, the independent Data Monitoring Committee found, based on preliminary data in an all comer population, that the addition of PEGPH20 given every two weeks to modified FOLFIRINOX would be unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of overall survival compared to modified FOLFIRINOX alone. Halozyme is working with SWOG to verify and analyze the initial data set, including a planned analysis by hyaluronan (HA) level, following completion of retrospective determination of tumor HA levels.

Now that the Ocaliva PCB label situation has been resolved with a simple warning label telling physicians not to overprescribe, we have seen a return to healthy sales growth rates. They are also the first NASH biotech to report positive phase 3 results, and will likely make it to market before MDGL, VKTX, CNAT, etc. But the projected 35B NASH market will likely be split based on different sub-indications, so there is room for multiple winners. An independent study estimates that a NASH drug that can reduce fibrosis could charge 5K/yr, but during the 2Q18 call, management would not comment on potential pricing. At this point, ICPT has recovered all of the drop from the Ocaliva safety scare that surfaced in the fall of 2017, so the risk-free opportunity has passed. Its not clear how much more upside this has because we dont have any guidance from management on the commercial prospects, so it seems like a good time to sell after the positive phase 3 results. Pass.

SUMMARY: 

EVENTS:'\n''\n'2/19/19: +25%. Announcement of positive results from a Phase 3 clinical trial, REGENERATE, evaluating obeticholic acid (OCA) in patients with liver fibrosis (scarring) due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The study met one co-primary endpoint, a statistically significant proportion of patients achieving at least one stage improvement in fibrosis with no worsening of NASH at month 18 (p=0.0002), but failed to meet the other, the proportion of patients achieving NASH resolution with no worsening of liver fibrosis. The FDA agreed that only one endpoint needed to be met in order to be judged successful.'\n''\n'10/31/18: +7%. 3Q18 was another good quarter, with ocaliva sales (47M, +14%) continuing to grow, cash burn slowing (due to lower personnel costs), and full-year guidance reaffirmed.'\n''\n'8/6/18: +13%. Goldman Sachs upgrade to PT 157.'\n''\n'8/2/18: +7%. 2Q18 beat on both top and bottom, with revs of 44M growing 44%, driven by strong Ocaliva sales. They are reaffirming full year guidance.'\n''\n'5/31/18: -5%. MDGL reports excellent week 36 follow-up data for phase 2 in NASH.'\n''\n'5/8/18: Flat. 1Q18

4/5/18: Prices public offering of 2.3M shares @ 64/share (about market price). Also agrees to sell 1.6M shares directly to certain current shareholders at the same price. Total gross proceeds 250M.

2/14/18: 4Q17 Ocaliva worldwide net sales 37M, US 32M. FY expenses flat at 273M vs 273M. 2018 OpEx guidance 390-410M. Prior to Christmas saw a sizeable increase in patient prescriptions.

2/1/18: FDA addressed the dosing issue with a new warning label saying that Ocaliva should not be overprescribed. This significantly de-risks ICPT.

11/1/17: 3Q17 Ocaliva worldwide net sales 41M, US 36M vs 27M sequentially. Company is also seeing an increased usage internationally. They are optimistic the label situation will be finalized by early 2018. Management feels reassured after the conclusion of an independent panel that was brought in to assess the situation revolving around the patient deaths. The FDA will use this panels report in making its decision.'\n''\n'July/September 2017: Big drop from 130 to 60 during is from 8 patient deaths. Some physicians were overly aggressive with the dosing of Ocaliva. 

PIPELINE: 

Ocaliva (obeticholic acid) + UDCA (ursodeoxycholic acid) (primary biliary cholangitis (PBC): Phase 4 confirmatory outcomes trial ongoing. Approved in US May 2016 and launched in June in adults with inadequate or intolerable response to UDCA (as monotherapy). EU granted conditional approval in December 2016. Since January 2017 Ocaliva has received approval in several other marktes such as Canada, Israel, and Australia. The condition previously known as primary biliary cirrhosis. PBC has no definitive cure. UDCA is only approved medication, along with Ocaliva. Ocaliva has thus far been exposed to 1,600 patients.

PBC affects women vs men at a rate of 10:1, and is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, affecting 1 in 1,000 women over 40 yrs old. The initial launch is focusing on the 19K patients (out of 130K prevalence, 55K diagnosed) that match the POISE phase 3 trial criteria.

Ocaliva (PBC): Phase 3 POISE. Announced top-line results (similar to interim data) on 4/13/18. After 3 years of treatment, the majority of patients improved (n=6/13, 46%) or maintained (n=5/13, 38%) histological fibrosis stage, while 2 patients (n=2/13, 15%) experienced one stage progression. Of the 4 patients with cirrhosis at baseline, n=4/4 showed reversal by at least one stage, and n=3/4 improved to fibrosis without cirrhosis. Pruritus (severe itching) is the most common symptom in patients with PBC and was also the most common AE, with n=9/13 (69%) experiencing pruritus. A total of 5 SAEs were reported but were considered to not be related to Ocaliva. 

Starting dosage is 5mg once-daily ($6,300/month or $75,600/yr), with an increase to 10-mg ($6,500/month) after 3 months if its well-tolerated and needed. Annualizing 3Q17 Ocaliva sales of 41M gives 164M. Dividing by yearly cost of 75,600 gives only 2,169 patients out of 19K that are so far taking it (worldwide market is over 40K). Sales could easily surpass 500M if current growth rate is maintained and black box warning is not issued.   

Ocaliva (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)): Phase 3 REGERNATE. Data expected 1H2019. US and EU prevalence is 125M (1).'\n''\n'Phase 2 data was very promising (35% vs 19% for fibrosis improvement in primary analysis, 39% vs 21% in follow-up analysis of high-risk patients), and drug was generally well-tolerated. 

Ocaliva (compensated cirrhosis due to NASH): Phase 3 REVERSE initiated 2/12/18.

INT-767 (dual FXR/TGR5 agonist) (NASH with liver fibrosis): Phase 2.

Ocaliva (primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)): Phase 2. PSC is an autoimmune liver disease with an estimated prevalence in US of 40K. Its an Orphan indication with no approved treatment UDCA is often used but not recommended).

Ocaliva (biliary atresia): Phase 2.

INGN,0.00,0.00,2020-06-25,34.90,"6/25/20 INGN QR: INGN is a medtech company that introduced the first portable oxygen concentrator (POC). Its a lightweight device (about the size of a computer tower) that aims to replace legacy oxygen concentrators primarily used by elderly patients with respiratory issues. These older concentrators are heavier, stationary, and require periodic oxygen tank deliveries. The product is very innovative and saw great CAGR (+42%) over a 10-year period, but flat 2019 sales brought the stock back down to earth. Management says the market will still take another 5+ years before POCs reach full penetration, which suggests more potential upside. But there are now at least two other POC makers in the sector, and SA articles explain that there is little differentiation between them. INGN has a great product and is a great company, but even after coming way down, the stock seems overvalued. Pass/q5.

PIPELINE: 

VGX-3100 (cervical dysplasia/HPV): Phase 3 REVEAL-1, phase 3 REVEAL-2. VGX-3100 is indicated for the treatment of 3 pre-cancerous diseases (cervical dysplasia, vulvar dysplasia, and anal dysplasia) caused by HPV types 16 and 18. It treats pre-cancer without invasive surgery, which is painful, complicated, and has recurrence rates of 10-50% (depending on the indication). There are no approved drugs to treat HPV 16 and 18. Competing vaccines like MRKs Gardasil 9 and GSKs Cervarix are only approved for the prevention of HPV, pre-cervical cancer, and cervical cancer but not as treatments. Also, surgical treatment options such as LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure) and Cold Knife Conization are invasive, cause many problems such as infection and pain, and have a 10-16% risk of the disease recurring. The annual incidence of HPV 16/18 + pre-cancers in the US/EU: cervical 195K/233K, vulvar 23K/EU15K, anal 13.4K/2.5K (not sure where these numbers came from but source #7 has something similar).'\n''\n'Peak sales estimate ex-China (all indications) 500M (1). On 3/20/18, they closed the partnership with ApolloBio to develop and commercialize VGX-3100 in China. INO will receive 23M upfront, 20M regulatory milestones, and double-digit royalties. Also provides for the potential inclusion of Korea within the next 3 years. China accounts for 28% (approx. 130K) of global new cervical cancer cases every year. In the US, 13K are diagnosed annually with cervical cancer.'\n'
Phase 2 results announced on 9/27/15 met all primary and secondary endpoints. The cervical HSIL regression to low or normal and HPV clearance was 40% treatment vs 14% control (n=167, p=0.001).

Regeneron will supply their PD-1 inhibitor REGN2810, and INO will manage and fund the trial. No financials mentioned (5).'\n''\n'Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is by far the most common and most malignant of the glial tumors. Of the estimated 17,000 primary brain tumors diagnosed in the United States each year, approximately 60% are gliomas. No current treatment is curative. The current standard of care consists of maximal safe surgical resection, radiotherapy, and concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide (2). '\n''\n'INO-5401+atezolizumab (bladder cancer): Phase 2 discontinued due to cost cutting. Signed a collaboration agreement with Genentech (an arm of Roche) on 6/3/17. Genentech will provide atezolizumab, and the trial will be managed by INO. At the moment, no financial terms are mentioned (4). In the US, 79K new cases were diagnosed in 2017 (3). Globally there are 430K cases diagnosed each year (4).

MEDIO457 (cervical cancer): Phase 2. 

MEDIO457 (INO-3112) +durvalumab (head and neck cancer): Phase 2. Announced partnership with AstraZeneca/MedImmune on 8/11/15 (6). The upfront payment was 28M, with potential for up to 700M in milestones and up to double-digit tiered royalties. On 1/8/18, INO received a 7M milestone payment for the initiation of the trial.

'\n''\n'Phase 1 results showed that 93% (n=71/76) showed a CD4+ or CD8+ cellular immune response to at least one of the vaccine antigens, and 94% (n=62/66) demonstrated an env specific antibody response.'\n''\n'INO-1800 (Hep B and liver cancer): Phase 1. 240M infected worldwide. Currently available antiviral treatments are not adequate to clear this infection and may only slow progression of the disease. 3/14/18: Announced positive interim phase 1 results. 

INO-4201 (Ebola): Phase 1. Announced DARPA partnership on 4/8/15, for a total of 45M over 2 years, and an 11M extension option. Announced positive preclinical data on 10/15/18 showing INO-4212, administered via IM injection in one study, elicited 100% protection against a lethal Ebola challenge. In another study, two intradermal injections of the vaccine candidate also provided 100% protection from a lethal Ebola challenge (both involved monkeys). Phase 1 showed 95% of patients (n=170/179) showed high levels of binding antibodies measured.

INO-3112 (now MEDI0457 by licensee AstraZeneca) (head and neck cancer): Phase 1 showed positive results. T-cell activation immunotherapy, showed antigen-specific T-cell stimulation, including a complete response in a patient with head and neck cancer who also received Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo (nivolumab).

INO-1400 (tumors): Phase 1 showed positive results. An hTERT-targeting immunotherapy, generated hTERT-specific IFN-_-secreting T cells which suggests an ability to surmount immune tolerance.

EU patent until 2035 (see 2Q19 earnings). US breakthrough, fast track, QDIP status. '\n''\n'MAC lung disease is a rare, progressive, and chronic condition that can cause severe, permanent damage to the lungs. Prior to the approval of Arikayce, there were no inhaled therapies approved specifically for the treatment of patients with MAC lung disease. Arikayce is an inhaled, once-daily formulation. The approval is only for patients with refractory MAC lung disease who have not responded to current treatment options, but the hope is that with additional trials, it can be approved as a front-line therapy, and for the entire set of NTM lung conditions. Some analysts think that even now, Arikayce will be prescribed off-label, given that current treatment options require being on antibiotics for at least 1 year, results are very poor (8), and there are serious adverse effects of long-term antibiotic treatment (9). Still, generic antibiotics are much cheaper than Arikayce.'\n''\n'The market was not happy that approval came with a black box warning, but management said its a warning that they would have given to physicians anyway. The rates of incidence for certain adverse events was higher with arikayce vs current standard of care (2), but the slightly increased risk of hospitalization from a respiratory issue seems like something patients should be able to accept, given how serious their condition is. Cowens analyst thinks it will have no impact on sales.'\n''\n'The main reason why we shouldnt assume large market penetration for Arikayce is that they have not shown clinical benefit. What they have shown from data readouts in September 2017 (7), January 2018 (5), and May 2019 (6) is that using Arikayce in addition to guideline-based therapy eliminated evidence of NTM lung disease caused by MAC in sputum (culture conversion). It would seem logical to assume that if the bacteria no longer registers as being present, that the patient would be better off. But for the September 2017 readout, they also reported data for a 6-minute walk test which indicated no statistically significant difference between patients in the two arms. An analysis of the data did show that patients who achieved culture conversion (in either arm) demonstrated an improvement in the 6-minute walk test compared with patients (in either arm) who did not culture convert. It would seem to follow that since more patients in the Arikayce + GBT arm achieved culture conversion compared with GBT alone, and achieving culture conversion improves your walking, that Arikayce improves your walking. But they still dont have data yet to prove this directly.

There have been many failures in attempting to treat this condition but they all were inhaled antibiotics trying to target the underlying inflammatory issues. INSMs approach is different so management says its like a lottery ticket at this point given the large market size but unknown results.

Catalysts:

Summary: Using 2018 EPS guidance of 3.37-3.73 and current price of 49.73 gives forward PE of 15.

A large part of the turnaround involved growing the data center offerings. Management said �we are becoming a data center company.�

1/25/18: 4Q17 earnings beat on both revs and EPS. 2018 revs guidance 64B-66B,  EPS 3.37-3.73. Segment performance: PC-centric Client Computing Group, $9B (-2% Y/Y); Data Center Group, $5.6B (+20%); Internet of Things Group, $879M (+21%); Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group, $889M (+9%); Programmable Solutions Group, $566M (+35%). 

10/26/17: Data-centric segment is now 45% of revenue. They did have an excellent quarter, hitting all-time records in revenue, op inc, and EPS growth. They also shipped their first modems to the auto industry, and this area has a lot of potential. There is an article on SA saying that leaked data shows that AMD�s Ryzen offerings may be superior to INTC�s new Coffee Lake product, so this would affect the Personal Computing segment, which at the moment is INTC�s biggest selling segment. Tianfang has a graph in his presentation showing AMD taking a very small amount of market share. The graph isn�t clear, but I think it�s referring to the PC segment (I have asked him to clarify). The NAND offering you mentioned falls under INTC�s Non-Volatile Memory Solutions Group. This segment increased from 649M to 891M YOY, but operated at a loss of (52M). I think the main concern is that slowly, AMD is taking market share in the PC segment by offering better and much cheaper processors. Secondly, AMD has expressed interest in competing in the data center market. �AMD has expressed desire to compete in data center business but it remains to be seen how competitive the company�s technology will be.� The data center business does 4,878M in sales, and so along with PC segment (8,860M sales), AMD capturing market share poses a real threat.

The ramp up for the installed base of G6 laser systems will be slower, but they think the better approach is to improve utilization with existing customers.

Gross margin improved due to the end of the voluntary recall from probe accessory issues. Gross margin will continue to improve as they roll out their new G6 probe which (at a lower cost to produce due to machine vs injection molding) will improve safety, consistency of results, and ease of use. SGA will continue to go up a bit as they hire more clinical specialists to boost G6 laser sales. The quarterly cash burn will hover at around 2.5M per quarter, so cash on hand of 21M will last another two years.

Traditional laser treatments have a high rate of failed IOP control after 12 months, and the long-term efficacy of stent devices (such as GKOSs iStent Inject) is unclear. Invasive surgery also has limited long-term efficacy as well as high complication and failure rates (2). An article in Cornea magazine shows IRIXs laser treatment is at least efficacious out to 12 months in reducing IOP (4).'\n''\n'CYCLO G6 LASER SYSTEM (non-recurring revs): Gross margins 50%. Commercialized February 2015. G6 has two key technological advantages over the competition: (1) its one of the only FDA-approved lasers that can treat early-, mid-, and late-stage glaucoma; and (2) unlike conventional, continuous-wave lasers, its proprietary micro-pulse technology emits an intermittent wave that allows the tissue to cool between laser pulses and prevents heat-caused tissue damage. '\n''\n'CYCLO G6 PROBES (recurring revs): The disposable G6 probes are a recurring revenue stream, since they must be replaced after 90 minutes of use (each procedure takes about two minutes). The new P3 probe set to launch 4Q19 will be cheaper to manufacture but is also less dependent on the doctors technique, so hopefully outcomes will improve and become more consistent. This is part of the strategy to get existing users to increase their utilization. They also want doctors to use it more with earlier-stage glaucoma patients and not just late-stage patients.'\n''\n'LEGACY RETINAL DISEASE SYSTEM: Annual sales are about 30M. There are 430M diabetics globally, and 28% (120M) will develop some form of diabetic macular edema, which is a swelling of the retina.

LIQUIDITY:'\n''\n'SEASONALITY: We experience seasonality in our business, reflecting a combination of traditional retail seasonality patterns and new patterns associated with online retail in particular. For example, we generally experience less user traffic and purchase orders during national holidays in China, particularly during the Chinese New Year holiday season in the first quarter of each year. Furthermore, sales in the traditional retail industry are significantly higher in the fourth quarter of each calendar year than in the preceding three quarters. E-commerce companies in China hold special promotional campaigns on November 11 each year, and we hold a special promotional campaign in the second quarter of each year, on June 18, to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of our business, both of which can affect our results for those quarters.

The big issue is that the number of active accounts declined sequentially. On the call they said that they are focused on getting high quality new users as they ove into 2nd tier cities, but did not respond to directly to why users went down. Perhaps the CEOs personal issues (rape allegations at University of Minnesota) played a part. They continue to increase opex spending as they build out the distribution infrastructure and marketing, but revs is not keeping up. 

8/16/18: -1%. 2Q18 beat on revs but missed slightly on EPS, as they continue to increase RD spending. The revs growth guidance midpoint for 3Q18 was also lower than this quarters growth rate. They saw softness in July due to seasonality, but normal growth has already returned for August.

Market does not like the possibility of another year-long trial for KPI-121 0.25% costing 50M, though management feels that the extra analysis they did after data readout that showed positive results should be enough to convince FDA of approval.'\n''\n'1/5/18: Down 30% on two phase 3 results for STRIDE 1 and 2. Only 3 out of 4 endpoints met, but showed trend towards treatment effect.

PIPELINE:

INVELTYS (KPI-121 1.0%) (post-operative ocular inflammation and pain): Approved 8/23/18. Commercialized 1/7/19. First 2x daily ocular corticosteroid. Current topical steroids are 4x daily. Current 4x daily treatment Lotemax sold $129M in 2016. There is a tradeoff with current steroid options: higher potency with risk of higher IOP, or lower potency with lower IOP. Management thinks INVELTYS offers a sweet spot int he middle and says 88% of physicians surveyed perceive it has a benefit. No safety issues.The most common adverse drug reactions in the clinical trials with INVELTYS were eye pain and posterior capsular opacification, both reported in 1% of patients. These reactions may have been the consequence of the surgical procedure (1, slide 11). However, there are some new products on the market from OMER, OCUL, and EYPT that aim to eliminate the need for postoperative steroid eyedrops altogether. Management/analyst peak sales estimates of $300M seem very unrealistic.'\n'
EYSUVIS (KPI-121 0.25%) (temporary relief of signs and symptoms of DED): Phase 3 STRIDE 3. EYSUVIS would be the first US drug approved for short-term flare-up treatment (as opposed to chronic DED) (4). On 3Q19 call (8, minute 9:40), management says that their market research shows that EYSUVIS could be used in mild to moderate DED patients who are only on OTC artificial tears, but also as an add-on rescue therapy to chorinic DED patients on Xiidra or Restasis (since these patients still experience flares). NVSs Xiidra was approved in 2016 for the treatment of signs and symptoms of DED (3), had 2018 sales of $400M, and was purchased from Takeda on 5/8/19 for $3.4B upfront and up to $1.9B in milestones ($5.3B total). Analysts expect $1B+ in Xiidra sales (5). '\n''\n'The drug was well-tolerated during STRIDE 1 and STRIDE 2. To clear up the skepticism from the missed secondary STRIDE 2 endpoint, they are running a third phase 3 trial (STRIDE 3) in 3Q18, with results available 1Q20. FDA issued CRL on 8/8/19 but said that results from STRIDE 3 will be enough to resubmit NDA.'\n''\n'The efficacy results of Xiidras pre-approval trials are similar to KALA. In 3 of 4 trials it showed a larger reduction in ICSS scores compared to placebo, but not incredible efficacy (6, section 14 CLINICAL STUDIES).  KALA announced mixed results for two phase 3 trials on 1/5/18 (2). Achieved statistical significance for the primary sign (objective measure) and symptom (subjective measure) endpoints for STRIDE 1, and primary sign endpoint for STRIDE 2, but missed on symptom endpoint. The symptom endpoint is basically a patient response and so is highly subjective. In the 3Q19 call (8, minute 18:20), management explained that steps were taken to reduce the placebo effect in STRIDE 3 (screen out patients that didnt have a stable baseline, remove patients that had significant improvement in symptoms during run-in phase, etc.). When they apply these exclusion criteria to STRIDE 2 they get a p value of 0.002, which would have shown statistical significance. They are optimistic these changes have successfully screened out problematic patients.  '\n''\n'Sun Pharma lauanched Cequa on 10/14/19 (7). Its phase trials were successful, but the results were not incredible. After 12 weeks (84 days) of treatment, CEQUA showed a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint, percentage of patients with an increase of at least 10 mm in Schirmers score (a measurement of tear production) from baseline (16.6% vs. 9.2%; p&lt;0.01). This endpoint does not compare directly with KALA. The most commonly reported ocular AE was instillation site pain (24.2% in the CEQUA group, vs. 4.3% for vehicle); of the 24.2% of patients who reported instillation site pain in the CEQUA group, most of them reported the pain as being mild (20.7%), 3.0% reported it as moderate, and 0.5% reported it as severe (see 10/14/19 press release).'\n''\n'Other treatments include overthecounter artificial tears, blockbuster Restasis, and offlabel use of corticosteroids. Its not a certain commercial success just because of how few people who suffer from DED actually take Rx, and because there are not current therapies from DED flares to validate the opportunity. A head-to-head trial against OTC artificial tears would have been more convincing than vs placeob.

Their pipeline is very large, and they have announced successful pilot studies for almost ten trials, but they dont release the full data and the trials are not head-to-head against competitors. This makes valuing the pipeline virtually impossible. The stock has not recovered at all from the COVID-19 sell-off and is basically at a 10-year low, so maybe its worth a small position.

SUMMARY:

EVENTS:

11/18/19 BO: +500% (over several days). Announce positive results from a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating KarXT in schizophrenia patients with acute psychoses. The study met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant change in a scale called PANSS at week 5 compared to placebo. Specifically, participants receiving KarXT showed a mean relative reduction in PANSS score of 11.6 points versus control (p&lt;0.0001). Historically, changes as small as five points have been sufficient for regulatory approval. On the safety front, the discontinuation rate was 20% compared to 21% for placebo.

PIPELINE:

KarXT (schizphrenia psychosis): Phase 3 initiattion end 2020. Since the 1950s, antipsychotic drugs have all utilized the same mechanism of action (dopamine receptor antagonists). Recent research has shown that muscarinic receptor agonists (i.e. xanomeline) are more effective at treating schizophrenia than legacy antipsychotics, but the unwanted side effects caused Eli Lilly to abandon development. The founder of KRTX hypothesized that if xanomeline was combined with a muscarinic receptor antagonist (i.e. trospium), it would mitigate the unwanted side effects but still preserve the efficacy of xanomeline alone. The phase 2 data announced on 11/18/19 validated this approach. This could be a paradigm-shifting moment in the treatment of antipsychotics.

Management says the power plant and oil sectors can be strong growth opportunities in the future, but at the moment their biggest opportunity lies in retrofitting shipping vessels with scrubbers. Its true that a recent regulation has cracked down on the amount of pollution ships can emit, but instead of paying to install scrubbers, shipping companies can also simply purchase low sulfur fuel to use instead. It has traditionally been more expensive, but recently the spread has narrowed, so for the near future it seems that this is what will determine whether LIQTs scrubber sales do well. Pass.

SUMMARY: 2018 EPS 4.10. Current price of 43.65 gives forward PE of 11.

One of the few manufacturers that can supply 3D sensors, which are going to see explosive usage in automotive, mobile, telecomm, datacomm, gesture recognition, creating game avatars, 3D modeling, photo shoot enhancing, etc.

The new iPhoneX contains augmented reality (""""AR"""") capabilities which would require 3D sensing technologies. New iPhone 8 3D sensing front camera likely uses VCSEL from LITE, revenue per phone estimated at $4-$5. 

Apple invested 390M in FNSR for Texas facility, but rollout of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSEL) has been botched (and can only produce 30M worth per quarter), so LITE will still be supplying in the near-term. In the long-term, FNSR facility won''t be ready until 2H19, and they still have to master 6-inch wafers, which is not a given since they have no experience with that. Apple plans on buying 10x more VCSELs than in previous quarters, so there is still a chance LITE will be a secondary supplier. But there will be ample opportunities from other customers.

LPCN-1107 (recurrent and spontaneous PTB): Phase 2 complete. Orphan Drug. Phase 3 will be head-to-head with current standard of care Makena (an HPC injection), which had 2017 sales of $387M. Makena requires 18-22 injections/weekly visit, causes site pain and swelling. LPCN-1107, an oral form of HPC, would be the first oral treatment to market, which should allow for premium pricing compared with generic injections. '\n''\n'However, there are concerns about Makenas effectiveness. MAKENA was shown in the preapproval clinical trial to reduce the proportion of women who delivered at less than 37 weeks gestation, a surrogate endpoint that FDA determined was reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit of preterm birth prevention, such as improved neonatal mortality and morbidity. As required under 21 CFR 314.510, the Applicant conducted a postapproval confirmatory clinical trial to verify and describe clinical benefit. AMAG Pharmaceuticals has disclosed that this completed confirmatory trial did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the treatment and placebo arms for the co-primary endpoints of reducing the risk of recurrent preterm birth or improving neonatal mortality and morbidity (6, 8). '\n''\n'Consumer advocacy group Public Citizen filed a petition on 10/8/19 (7) requesting it be removed from the marekt. On 10/29/19 (5), the FDA held an AdComm to discuss removing Makena from the market. The vote was 13-3 that the clinical data (Trials 002 and 003 (8)) in the companys application failed to demonstrate substantial evidence of effectiveness. The follow-up vote was 9-7 against leaving Makena on the market (was approved under accelerated approval) and requiring a new confirmatory trial. Five of the six who practice obstetrics voted to keep Makena on the market and generate more data.  The final FDA decision has not happened yet.'\n''\n'Thus far, we dont have data showing that LPCN-1107 reduces PTBs. What has been shown in a phase 1a study of non-pregnant women (5/15/14 (4)), a phase 1b study of pregnant women (1/12/15 (3)), and a phase 2 study of pregnant women (2/16/16 (1)) is that an oral dose of LPCN-1107 is able to be absorbed successfully, leading to elevated levels of HPC as demonstrated by assayed plasma samples.

In July, UTC filed an amended complaint asserting infringement of an additional recently issued U.S. Patent No. 10,716,793 (793). Although UTCs amended complaint brings the 793 patent into the pending lawsuit, the statutory 30-month stay on regulatory approval, is not associated with the allegations of infringement of the 793 patent and the allegations of infringement of this patent should have no effect on the FDAs review of the LIQ861 NDA.'\n''\n''\n'6/29/20 AH: -21%.

Meets primary endpoint and was well-tolerated at 2 months of treatment. '\n''\n'PIPELINE:'\n''\n'LIQ861 (PAH): Phase 3 INSPIRE complete. LIQ861 is an inhaled dry powder formulation of UTHRs currently marketed Tyvaso (treprostinil) designed to enhance deep-lung delivery and maximize the therapeutic benefits of treprostinil in treating PAH by safely delivering higher doses into the lungs. They are seeking approval approval of LIQ861 under the 505(b)(2) pathway, which will allow us to rely in part on the FDAs previous findings of efficacy and safety of Tyvaso (U.T.C.) and the active ingredient treprostinil (1). Tyvaso had 3Q19 net sales of $111M (5, pg 20). And the PAH market is very large at $3.6B (7, slide 3).'\n''\n'Phase 3 INSPIRE results were announced on 3/11/19 (2) but did not move the stock much. It was well-tolerated, with 93% (n=101/109) completing at least 2 months of treatment with no reported SAEs and only mild to moderate AEs. I think the reason the stock did not go up is because the primary endpoint was simply to establish the long-term safety and tolerability of inhaled trepostinil (3). What they have shown is that at doses of up to twice the prescribed Tyvaso dose (6), no safety issues arise at 2 months. '\n''\n''\n'Even if the long-term extension data shows no safety issues, its not clear this will take meaningful market share from Tyvaso. The December 2019 presentation points out some of the shortcomings of current PAH treatments (6, slides 10 and 11). For example, Tyvaso needs to be washed daily and has a lot of parts, whereas LIQ861 is disposable. But these points of differentiation dont seem super compelling. '\n''\n''\n'Also, UTHR has a LIQ861 copycat product called Trepostinil Technosphere (partnered with MNKD) that is in phase 3 testing. One point of differentiation is that MNKDs inhalation mechanism of action involves an excipient compound called FDKP (8). Thus far I have not found any studies showing that FDKP is harmful (9), but a comment on SA indicates that there might be long-term side effects of its use (10). On the Afrezza website, lung cancer is discussed as a risk, though it says that there have been too few cases at this point to know for sure (10). LQDAs PRINT technology simply involves modifying the medication to be delivered without adding any substances to it, so there is a chance it might be safer, and probably also cheaper to manufacture. But there is no data to support this yet.      '\n''\n''\n'LQDA will have a head start over Trepostinil Technosphere, which just started phase 3 at the end of 2019 and probably wont make it to market until 2022. But without compelling efficacy data, it seems like an uphill battle for LQDA to by itself take market share from the established PAH incumbent UTHR.

We expect a disproportionate amount of transactions on our marketplaces to occur at certain times during the year (**BUT 10-K DOES NOT SAY WHICH SEASON**).'\n''\n'SUMMARY: 
Decline from 2012 because: 1) renegotiated DOD contracts at lower rates; 2) walked away from Walmart contract when WMT wanted to alter terms (still a customer); 3) downturn in oil/gas business. Company has zero debt and losses have stabilized at under (13M) per quarter.

Main competitor IronPlanet was purchased by RBA in Aug 2016 for 700M. Estimated that IronPlanets GMV was similar to LQDTs, though margins and operating income were better. But the thesis is that over time, LQDTs margins will converge given the parallel structures of the businesses. The shift to the LiquidityOne platform will help that convergence, as it is consolidating 8 different marketplaces into one, and will save 6-8M per year. Will be done by end of 2018.

Also, CEO owns 18% of stock.

3 Segments:

GovDeals: Growing segment and difficult barrier to entry for competitors. Is expanding geographic reach to new states. Has over 9K municipalities signed up (over 90K in US), up from 6K in 2015. Next largest competitor is estimated to have 1K. Market very fragmented. Comments from municipalities interviewed is that they get better offers online than when they limit themselves to local buyers that attend local auctions. 

Capital Assets Group (CAG): Unexpected recent headwinds from delayed asset sales (DOD and industrials) account for poor performance. But important to keep in mind that asset sales can be very lumpy.

Retail Supply Chain Group (RSCG): Small segment but growing. 

EVENTS:'\n''\n'8/6/20 BO: +12%. 3QFY20. Cash 73M, pos. Debt 0M. Registered auction buyers continues to grow slowly (+2.5%) but its not clear what will be the catalyst for stronger growth. Pass.

They saw nice +19% GMV growth in Q4-FY18, excluding the expired DoD Surplus contract, and expect it to continue in 1QFY19. The adj net loss also improved to -5M from -10M. These significant improvements were driven by strong top-line growth in our RSCG and GovDeals segments, substantial benefits of restructuring in our commercial tag business, restructuring of the corporate functions and overall lower technology expenses. LiquidityOne, the single consolidated online marketplace, should be online during FY2019. Things are moving in the right direction, but very slowly.'\n''\n'8/2/18: +5%. 3Q18 delivered positive operating cashflow and overall organic growth in GMV, excluding the DOD surplus contract, which has now been terminated. The CAG segment saw declines in GMV and revenue, but this is due to the discontinued DOD contract (this also accounts for the decline in overall segment revs). The LiquidityOne platform should launch the new, consolidated all-in-one marketplace platform in early 2019. Management think this will really drive more traffic and sales. They expect the recent acquisition of Machinio to be cashflow neutral but have a temporary GAAP dilutive impact on 4Q18. Guidance for 4Q18 contained no negative surprises. They will still have a net loss, but it continues to trend towards break-even.'\n'
5/3/18: -13%. 2Q18 saw lower than expected seller activity due to the timing of some plant closures and severe weather on the East Coast. The market also did not like 3Q18 adjusted EPS guidance that is a bit below consensus. But things continue to move in the right direction. LQDT continues to add large municipal sellers and is still at less than 10% penetration nationally. And expenses will be slightly higher just for next quarter, as the DOD Surplus contract winds down and migration of all platforms continues.

2/1/18: 1Q18 revs 61M, -14% YOY. But YOY comparison is not a good metric, as there were large assets sales that took place one year ago. Also, they are winding down their DOD work (by May 2018), as new rules make the contracts unattractive for them. But there will be savings from expense cuts of 12-14M, and realignment of Truckcenter and Iron Direct business will offset this. 2Q18 guidance GMV 150M-170M, net loss 6-8M. 

12/4/17: 4Q earnings down 12%. Revs miss by 2.77M, EPS miss by 0.09. Revs of 61M, -22% YOY. GMV 145M, -9%. Net loss 14M. Rollout of all major market places expected to be completed by early FY 2019. GovDeals segment GMV growth +15.8% to 70M. RSCG GMV growth +18.4% to 30M. CAG segment GMV 44.6M, saw headwinds due to delayed plant closings in industrial verticals and impact of storms on energy verticals.

Summary: Shipping company with routes in Hawaii, Alaska, China, and Guam.

2/21/18: 4Q17 revs 516M, -0.6% YOY. EPS 0.28. 2017 EPS 1.78. Overall, 2017 was a solid year but for 2018, they expect to face continued competitive pressure in Guam and modestly lower volume in China coming off an exceptionally strong year. As a result, expect 2018 operating income to approximate 2017 level of 129M.

August 2017: Drops on news that TOTE Maritime announced plans to establish a new West Coast-to-Hawaii shipping route. For this past quarter, MATX did 38,600 in container volume and 16,500 in automobile volume to Hawaii. Given that total non-Hawaii container volume was 42,300 (between Alaska, Guam, Micronesia, and others), Hawaii container volume represents slightly under 50% of total container volume. Add in the automobile volume (no other locations report automobiles), and Hawaii is more than half of their revenue. In this respect, I guess the threat of a new entrant that might one day split the market with them justifies the drop. But it�s likely a few years before TOTE gets the route up and running, as they have just recently signed the letter of intent for the ships (one comment said 2020). MATX cash is 15.3M, current assets 282M, current liabilities 276M, and debt 723M. No balloon payment due until 2020 (21M). Not great, but no immediate concerns either, as they are profitable. Q2 net income was 24M. Given how far off TOTE�s entrance may be, perhaps the drop was an overreaction. But given what a sizeable portion of sales Hawaii is, perhaps not such an overreaction. Doesn�t seem like a screaming buy, though it�s difficult to know if volume shipping to Hawaii correlates exactly to revenue. The revenue is not broken down by location. I would guess that shipping to Alaska or Guam is more expensive from  Los Angeles, so maybe Hawaii makes up even less than my estimated slightly-less-than-half of revenue guess.

PIPELINE:

Inclisiran (cholesterol): Phase 3 ORION 9. There appears to be some differentiation between the mechanism of action for Inclisiran and AMGNs Repatha and SNYs Praluent. Repatha and Praluent are both based on anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies that bind to PCSK9 in blood. Inclisiran works upstream by turning off PCSK9 synthesis in liver. 

The concern at this point is that while the PCSK9 inhibitors have shown to be effective at significantly reducing LDL-c count, it hasnt translated to a corresponding large drop in cardiovascular events. For Repatha and Praluent the drop in cardiovascular events was only about 15%. Cardiovascular outcomes has been added to the phase 3 Inclisiran study, and so this data will be key to estimate if there will be a significant difference in outcomes. At this point, the positive phase 2 data regarding LDL-c reduction doesnt really help us without the corresponding drop in cardiovascular events. 

Didnt find any commentary implying that targeting the liver would prove to be more effective, but it would allow for a cheaper drug and less frequent dosing. Repatha and Praluent each cost about 14K/yr, and require 24 doses per year, whereas Inclisiran will only require 2 doses per year (no mention yet of price, but we could assume a proportional reduction based on 1/12 the dosing). Insurers have been reluctant to extend their support to these pricey treatments, so maybe a cheaper Inclisiran will be better received, even if the efficacy is similar. 

There was an interesting comment that Inclisran could potentially become a once per year vaccine-like treatment starting at the age of 30 to prevent future cardiovascular disease.

PIPELINE:

MGL-3196 (NASH): Phase 2 complete. Sustained benefit at week 36 from data reported on 5/31/18 sent the stock up +140%. 39% of responders at week 12 showed complete NASH resolution at week 36 vs 6% placebo (p=0.001). Fibrosis was resolved in half the patients. Mean liver fat reduction was 37% in treatment groups vs 9% placebo. No new safety issues. Phase 3 is up next.  '\n''\n''\n'Stunning NASH 12-wk data came out in September sent stock up 500%. A reduction in liver fat of 30% more is known to be indicative of an improved NASH condition. In all-MGL-3196 arm, 60% of patients had at least a 30% liver fat reduction, vs 75% in the high-MGL-3196 arm vs 18% placebo. Both arms were statistically significant with p=.0001. All secondary endpoints met statistical significance, and drug was well-tolerated. Study remains blinded and will be reassessed at 36 weeks. 

MGL-3196 (Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH)) + current cholesterol lowering regimen: Phase 2 complete. Oral, once-daily medication. HeFG is a severe genetic dyslipidemias typically caused by inactivating mutations in the LDL receptor. Both forms of FH lead to early onset cardiovascular disease. HeFH, the most common dominantly inherited disease, is present in up to 1 in 200 people.

Unmet need to lower cholesterol for high-risk HeFH patients whose disease is not well-controlled. Treatments exist for both HeFH and HoFH but many patients (as many as 40% of HeFH patients) are not able to reach their cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction goals on these therapies, reflecting the lifetime burden of cholesterol buildup in their bodies. There was evidence of impressive LDL cholesterol lowering in Phase 1, and data suggesting that MGL-3196 has a mechanism of action that is different from and complementary to statins.

'\n''\n'7/29/19 AH: -30%. 2Q19 did not show an improvement in operating performance. Management now says we have to wait until 2020 to see the benefits of CBI merger. Lowered guidance for 2019 driven by four main factors: 1) the weaker than expected operating results for the second quarter of 2019; 2) the impact of reduced revenues and higher unallocated operating expenses due to slippage in certain new awards and customer changes to schedule on several projects; 3) changes in our assumptions about the expected performance of legacy CB&amp;I projects in our NCSA operating segment; and 4) a shift from the fourth quarter of 2019 to 2020 in the assumed timing of remaining incentives on the Cameron LNG project. Full-year guidance assumes a sharp improvement in operating income in the fourth quarter of 2019, as the company builds momentum heading into 2020. The long-term outlook remains unchanged, but in the short term they will likely tap the credit facility, and investors will not like the increased debt.

Also, the CBI integration costs for the year increased about 80M. Other than that there were no surprises. No new cost overruns. The top-line guidance is the same. 1Q19 backlog gives visibility for 80% of 2019 expected total revs, and more than $9B for 2020 and thereafter. The sale of the pipe fabrication business is expected to close 2Q19, and the sale of the tank business in 3Q19.

And they are selling two business segments that generate 1.5B in revs for 1B. 2H18 guidance metrics for cashflow were lowered due to the increased costs from the CBI legacy projects.

The backlog stands at 10.2B (a bit lower than the pro-forma pre-merger amount due to a change in accounting policies which prohibits backlog from being recognized unless a future customer obligation without a customer decisions is in place), and the sales pipeline at 78.5B. They have identified 3 legacy CBI projects which will cost a bit more to complete than originally expected (Cameron 165M, Calpine 23M, IPL 33M), but still within the range that had been determined during the pre-merger due diligence. The guidance for 2H18 shows that the merger synergies are being realized.

MDR shareholders would own 53% and CBI would own 47%, while being entitled to receive 2.47 MDR shares for each CBI share owned (or 0.82407 shares if MDR initiates 3-to-1 reverse stock split). Cost synergies will be 250M (now 350M) plus some revenue synergies.

MDR shareholders do not seem to like the deal, as they are the better company. CBI was doing very well a few years ago, posting revenues of 9.4B, 10.8B, and 10.6B from 2013  2015. Gross margins were between 10-12%, and net income was about 500M. But management made some bad decisions in going after some unprofitable projects and some non-synergistic acquisitions. In 2017, revenues and margins were down to 6.7B and 0.11%. The thinking is that MDRs management, which successfully turned around MDR a few years ago, can do the same with CBI.

11/1/17: 3Q earnings are good all-around. Revenue up 71% YOY. The One McDermott Way plan is moving ahead nicely, with two new significant awards received for projects in the Middle East and India.

5/2/18: -3% AH. 1Q18 is a solid beat and 2018 guidance is raised. Everything is moving in the right direction, with mobile and video revenue increasing, and monetization per user increasing as well. As expected, programmatic advertising pricing, and consequently advertising revenue, continues to decline, falling 36% YOY. While user monetization is growing, a large part of that is video revenue, which is much lower margin than advertising. Because of this, the increase in revenue isnt falling to the bottom line by the same amount. 
Also, the announcement of Facebook entering the online dating world perhaps dampened the upward reaction that should have occurred from the strong revenue growth and upward guidance revision. Its still early, but management believes that Facebooks dating feature will not have a material impact on MEET. Facebooks previous ventures into job postings and selling didnt affect LinkedIn or Ebay. And the dating industry has tended to be very fragmented, and it likely wont turn into a winner-take-all market in the way that social media platforms have.

AMZEEQ (minocycline) topical foam, 4% (moderate to severe acne): US approval 10/18/19 (1). Launch January 2020. The first topical minocycline to be approved by the FDA for any condition. Minocycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic known for its efficacy in treating moderate to severe acne, but its use is limited in some patients due to systemic side effects when taken orally. Until now, minocycline has not been available as a topical treatment due to its instability in traditional topical formulations. In AMZEEQ, Foamix has leveraged its proprietary Molecule Stabilizing Technology (MST) platform to effectively deliver minocycline in a foam-based vehicle. Management called the FDA approval a milestone advancement in dermatology.  

ZILXI (FMX103) (rosacea): FDA approval 6/2/20. Launch 4Q20. Rosacea is a smaller market than acne but a bit less crowded.

The study met the primary endpoint of the number (n=0/17) of patients requiring IV anesthetic within the first 24 hours after initiation of ganaxolone therapy. Median time to the cessation of seizure(s) was five minutes. On the safety front, there were 10 serious adverse events, two considered treatment-related (severe sedation leading to discontinuation of therapy).

Announced intravenous (IV) ganaxolone results from Part 2 of its Phase 2 Magnolia clinical trial, evaluating IV ganaxolone followed by daily oral ganaxolone in women with PPD. The results showed that, in the study, ganaxolone administered as a six-hour infusion followed by oral administration was generally safe, well-tolerated and provided clinically meaningful reductions in HAM-D17 scores at early time points of 6 hours and 24 hours after start of treatment. HAM-D17 scores at 28 days of treatment were not different from placebo. Management thinks there is a path forward but I would not assign much value to ganaxolone at this point. SAGE is much farther ahead, having launched their safe and effective depression drug Zulpresso on 7/1/19. No head to head trial has been run, but in previous results, SAGE showed clear separation from placebo at 60 hours whereas MRNS did not.

SAGE has priced its PPD med Zulresso (brexanolone) at $7,450 per vial or $34,000 per average course of treatment (before discounts). The company says it does not expect to have to rebate a significant portion to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Originally, the company planned for the drug to be administered in the home, but fainting episodes in a small number of patients (n=6/140) during the 60-hour infusion eliminated that option. Instead, the company will establish designated centers where patients can access it under medical supervision, a certification process that could take months according to chief business officer Mike Cloonan. Stifels Paul Matteis forecasts peak sales of $270M in 2023, presenting only a 10% market penetration.

In the CDD cohort of patients, ganaxolone showed sustained, long-term effectiveness in treating children with CDD.

MTNB claims that lead candidate MAT9001 proved itself to be better than Vascepa in a phase 2 head-to-head trial. However, there is much disagreement amongst SA readers over whether MTNB ran the head-to-head trial correctly (AMRN even made a statement saying MTNB had not run the trial according to Vascepas label). The low market price also seems to suggest that investors are skeptical of MTNBs claims of superiority, as is their inability to secure a partnership two years ago after hiring advisors to assist in the search process. AMRN has also lost a patent dispute recently, so the threat of Vascepa generic entrants in the near future are also likely weighing down MTNB. Not enough data yet to make this compelling. Q5/pass.

SUMMARY: They are a multi-level marketing (MLM) type company that predominantly sells in China. The risk for some time has been the Chinese government telling them they can no longer operate there, given the poor press other Chinese MLMs have brought upon themselves. Interestingly, they dont require members to buy minimum bulk orders, as other MLM companies do.

Management has taken steps to address the declining membership and revenue numbers by enhancing the incentive programs, adjusting the bonus and reward programs to provide more resources to the most productive and up-and-coming members, and ease rank advancement. This should help attract, motivate and retain a strong member base.

Also, these past two years have seen some one-time events (G8 summit, 20th anniversary of Hong Kongs handover, etc.) that briefly halted members operations.

Data for NKTR-214 since then has shown that its not the miracle cancer drug that had been hoped for, but it (and their other early stage oncology candidates) obviously still hold enough potential to justify BMY sticking around and expanding into new trials.

Announce preliminary data for data for bempeg (NKTR-214) + nivolumab in patients with advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The total ORR was low at 13% (n=5/38), but prognosis for TNBC patients currently sees very poor ORRs (PD-L1+: 5-24%; PD-L1-: 0-5%; &gt;2L: 6%) (3). NKTR saw similar ORRs across PD-L1+ and PD-L1- patients (14% and 16%, respectively). But they would seem to have move of a competitive edge going after the PD-L1- patients. Its also worth mentioning that ORR was 21% (5/24) in the &gt;2/3L metastatic patients, with an ORR of 23% (3/13) in &gt;2/3L metastatic patients who had a PD-L1 negative baseline tumor status. So going after second- and third-line patients would also seem like a good strategy. The stock is down a bit today, but it could also just be because the market is down.

Strong buying opportunity (but Im not sure it retraces right away). Two main takeaways from the earnings call:'\n''\n'1) NKTR-181 (non-addictive opioid): They have no further update regarding when the cancelled AdComm will be rescheduled for (they hope by year end) or what the FDA will do with their PDUFA date of 8/29/19. But interstingly, they did say that they continue to have the customary pre-AdComm labeling discussions with the FDA, and the FDA continues to review their NDA. I still see a high probability that this gets approved and is successful commercially, but I would guess the commercial launch does not happen this year.'\n''\n'2) NKTR-214 (bempeg) (oncology candidate): This is why the stock is down. They revealed that of the initial 22 batches of medicine that were used in very early trials, 2 of the batches were tainted. They do see some minor trending towards higher rates of AEs with the 20 non-tainted batches, but overall NKTR-214 seems to be well-tolerated and has acceptable side effects compared with other cancer treatments, so safety is not the issue here. It seems that the 2 tainted batches had less potency than normal. This difference in results between patient groups is actually what spurred them to investigate to see if there was some underlying quality control issue. This certainly puts their credibility into question, but in the end, it should improve their results. An early analysis shows that the efficacy results are significantly better among the non-tainted batches compared with the tainted ones. Its worth pointing out that the FDA recently granted NKTR-214 Breakthrough Therapy Designation based on the pooled data of both tainted and non-tainted batches, and that the FDA was aware of this difference in batches when it granted BTD (an analyst asked this specifically). Also, of the 3 registration trials currently ongoing, none of the patients have received tainted batches of medicine, and so they see no need to start any trial over with a clean slate (an analyst asked this specifically). Theoretically, their future efficacy results should improve given this news. Most importantly, there is no clawback provision in the partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb that would put into jeopardy the $1B they received upfront, and there is no renegotiation discussion with Bristol that is taking place.

There are still 4 patients on treatment and of these, 2 are at 80% tumor reduction, so the CR could improve to 39% if they get to 100% tumor reduction). We are seeing exactly what management had predicted: a deepending of response rates over time. Next up is a phase 3 trial which will read out 3Q20.

Wainwright analyst Debjit Chattopadhyay believes Roches (RHHBY) preliminary data of RO6875281, a fibroblast activation protein targeted interleukin-2 variant, should concern the bulls of Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR). The 11% and 20% overall response rate for single agent RO6875281 in squamous cell head and neck cancer and melanoma is compelling, Chattopadhyay tells investors in a research note. Nektars NKTR-214 had no monotherapy activity, and the early promise in combination with Opdivo has faded potentially due to its limited PK profile, the analyst adds. In addition, Chattopadhyay believes the monotherapy activity with pegilodecakin, a pegylated IL-10 being developed by Eli Lily (LLY), further complicates the competitive landscape for NKTR-214. He believes the second generation of not alpha IL-2, which is poised to enter the clinic during 2019, could further upend NKTR-214 and might compel Nektars partner Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) to re-evaluate the aggressive development strategy that was outlined earlier this year.

PIPELINE:

NKTR-181 (chronic low back pain): Phase 3 SUMMIT complete. Unpartnered. Fast Track. Opioid market is upwards of 20B. Market size is 39M (19% of US population). NDA submitted on 5/31/18.

NKTR-181 is the first new chemical entity in the pain killer segment since morphine was introduced during the Civil War. It is a mu-opioid agonist that offers the benefits of pain killers without the addiction. Accelerated study showed that there was no identifiable difference between the level of desire patients expressed for NKTR-181 vs placebo. So far over 2K patients have been treated with it with no tolerability issues. Will look to partner for commercialization.  '\n''\n'NKTR-214 (immuno-oncology): market size 30B+ (1) (all indications below).

NKTR-214 + Opdivo (melanoma): Phase 3 PIVOT-02 commenced September 2018. Will test NKTR-214 + opdivo vs opdivo monotherapy.'\n'EFFICACY: In 2015, an opdivo + yervoy study in melanoma showed an ORR of 58% (n=181/314) and a CR rate of 11.5% (at 12 months). On 11/9/18, updated PIVOT-02 phase 1/2 data was released for opdivo + NKTR-214. The ORR 53% (n=20/38) is disappointing, as it is no better than the ORR that was seen at ASCO a few months ago, and is still no better than the yervoy combo. However, the CR rate was 24% (n=9/38) (at 7 months), with management continuing to see a deepening of response over time. So by the time we get to 12 months, the CR rate for the NKTR-214 combo could be even higher. The phase 3 trial being initiated will contain 764 patients and should provide a definitive answer as to whether adding NKTR-214 improves the efficacy for the current standard of care.'\n'SAFETY: The 2015 opdivo + yervoy study showed a 59% incidence of treatment-related grade 3 or 4 AEs. On 11/9/18, NKTR announced data showing a 20% (n=8/41) incidence in treatment-related grade 3 or 4 AEs for the NKTR-214 + opdivo combo (this is consistent with the 14% incidence observed at ASCO). Usually adding a 2nd cancer-fighting agent increases toxicity levels, so its promising that the most common side effects are flu-like symptoms which are easily managed. Management feels that this improved safety profile can really help NKTR-214 differentiate itself and become the standard of care instead of yervoy.'\n''\n'NKTR-214 + Opdivo (sarcoma):
'\n'NKTR-214 + nivolumab (advanced/metastatic TNBC): Phase 1/2 PIVOT-02. See 9/26/19. PD-L1- represents 60% of TNBC patients (discussed during at minute 9:30 on 9/26/19 call).'\n'

Its Senza Omnia is a spinal cord stimulation (SCS) device that is implanted into the lower back and delivers electric current into the spinal cord to block pain signals heading to the brain. SCS devices have been around for decades but have only been approved for delivering currents of 1kHz. NVROs Senza Omnia (launched in 2015) can deliver all currents and waveforms up to 10kHz, and this enhanced flexibility at higher current levels has proven itself to generate better response results in many clinical trials. Their device is currently approved for the core market of leg and back pain, but they hope to expand into other pain indications such as head and neck, diabetic neuropathy, etc. The risk here is whether NVROs device can dramaticlaly increase SCS treatment adoption. Currently, total SCS market penetration is about 10%. At a cost of $50k+ for the implant (and then maintenance of $5k-$10k/yr), market share ex-US seems unlikely to increase much, which explains why international sales for NVRO are basically flat. For 2019, sales were $390M and CFO was -$50M (and this excludes $40M+ of stock compensation). For 2020, sales guidance was for $437M (+12%), so it continues to grow nicely but will still be cashflow negative at least until 2022. Given the market cap of $4B, we would need net income of $200M just to get to a PE of 20x. The high stock compensation and the high valuation make this a pass.

The issue with OMER's Omidria is that even receiving a permanent J-code (I think it was) did not guarantee it permanent pass-through status, so once pass-through status expires after 2-3 years physicians will switch to generics because they cannot bill separately anymore. It's not clear if this permanent code for Dextenxa gives them permanent pass-through status. The recent SA author we messaged did not know and no recent articles on OCUL discuss this.

Comps have been at least -4% for 6 of the past 7 quarters at the Retail segment, which still represents 42% of total revs and is the highest margin segment. Revs growth at CompuCom again was poor at -6%, and this is the segment that is supposed to transition them away from legacy retail to IT/digital services. They did say that they booked 300M in new contracts for CompuCom during the quarter, so this would show organic growth. But its not clear that we can assume they will start doing 300M every quarter going forward, as no guidance was given on this. The increase in the authorized amount for share buybacks from 100M to 200M is good news, and assuming its all utilized at current prices, the forward PE is again 5.

Prices concurrent offering of 6.9M shares @ $14.50/share for proceeds of $100M, and $210M principal amount of 5.25% convertible senior notes due 2026 (this replaces existing 6.25% Notes). The initial conversion rate for the 2026 Convertible Notes is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $18.49/share, which represents a premium of approximately 27.5% over the public offering price of Omeros common stock in the Equity Offering of $14.50/share).

Omidria sales again grew 12% qoq. Additional narsoplimab data for HSCT-TMA continues to look very strong, far surpassing the FDA-agreed threshold for efficacy and expected survival rates. All AEs and SAEs continue to be expected for stem-cell transplant patients. The Non-Opioids Prevent Addiction in the Nation (NOPAIN) Act was introduced in the both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate during the fourth quarter. The proposed legislation has strong bipartisan backing in both chambers of Congress and is supported by a diverse group of grassroots organizations. If passed, the legislation would mandate separate payment by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for a period of five years for non-opioid pain treatments used during surgery, like OMIDRIA. q1. cp 24k. tp 19k.'\n''\n'12/5/19 BO: -13%.

CMS releases documents stating that at this time, they do not have sufficient evidence to justify permanent reimbursement for Omidria past next years expiration. (***Monday morning they released the results of a study which found that OMIDRIA cut intraoperative pain scores in half while markedly reducing the need for fentanyl during cataract surgery. Although CMS had received an analysis of the Donnenfeld data, CMS specifically requested peer-reviewed published evidence and the Donnenfeld study had not yet been published at the time the final rule was issued. With the publication of the Donnenfeld opioid-sparing data, Omeros believes that OMIDRIA meets all of CMS requirements for the non-opioid exclusion.) This does not affect narsoplimab approval at all, but another round of dilution seems certain given that their Omidria-receivables-backed line of credit will disappear 10/1/20 and narsoplimab will (ideally) just be hitting the market at that time. This will likely drift so I wouldnt add. q1. cp 31k. tp 29k'\n''\n'8/8/19 AH: +12%. 2Q19. Liquidity 60M (cash 32M), burn 8M.

Omidria annualized run-rate in December back up over 100M. they only show 60M as of December 31, but they just raised 210M in November from a notes offering. Total OpEx is 40M per quarter, so even at 100M+ per year (as of December), Omidria is not enough to cover expenses. It will probably go back up to 150M, but it will take a couple more quarters.

Annualized run-rate for Omidria at 100M.'\n''\n'11/9/18: -18%. 3Q18 results were in-line, but they co-announced a convertible debt offering of $210M aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Convertible Senior Note due 2023 at par. Initial buyers will have an option to purchase up to an additional $40M of the Notes. The initial conversion rate will be 52.0183 common shares per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes (~$19.22/share). Market price 16.02/share (premium 20%). Results from the second reported cohort from Omeros ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy are consistent with the first cohort and demonstrated significant reductions in proteinuria ranging from greater than 50% to approximately 70% following extended treatment with OMS721.'\n''\n'Omidria 5M vs 22M (due to temporary loss of pass-through status)'\n''\n'10/23/18: +7%.

However, there was no separation from placebo in this trial at 12 weeks.'\n''\n'8/9/18: +2% AH, -15%. 2Q18 had no surprises. Omidria pass-through status resumes 10/1/18 and will last until 9/30/20. They will retain the current ASP rate of $466 until 2Q19, at which point it will be re-calculated using the usual methods. There number of trials is expanding so costs are going up, but this was expected. And they have borrowed the remaining 45M from the credit facilty, but this also was expected. Management said the objective is still to file the BLA for OMS-721 this year, but it might not be as quickly as they had hoped. But the drop seems unjustified. Cash 88M.'\n''\n'7/23/18: +7%. Omidria EU commercialization begins.'\n''\n'5/10/18: +23%. 1Q18 sales results were low, but Omidria pass-through reimbursement will commence starting in 3Q18. And OMER is preparing their rolling BLA submission for OMS-721 for 2H18.

4/26/18: +9%. OMS721 receives Breakthrough Designation for HCT-TMA.

4/12/18: +5% Omidria is added to VA Formulary.

4/11/18: +13% CRG credit facility covenants have been met for 2018, and has been amended for 2019 and beyond to reduce the minimum required market cap to meet covenants from 6.4x to 3x loan principal outstanding. OMER can still borrow up to 45M up to 5/20/18 at its discretion. OMER will issue 200K warrants to the lenders at an exercise price of 23.00/share (current price 15.12). 

3/22/18: +35% With new spending bill, Congress allows OMER to charge higher reimbursement rates for Omidria for another two years. 

3/1/18: 4Q17 revs 14M, +7% YOY, but -37% sequentially. Net loss 17M, EPS -0.34. Lenders have agreed to extend 45M borrowing capacity until May 20, 2018, regardless of minimum sales or market cap requirements not being met. Management stated that the sales requirement (2017 sales were 65M and met the requirement) can be met with grant or partnership money as well, so perhaps a partnership announcement is on the way.

11/10/17: 3Q earnings saw Omidria revs of 22M, +26% sequentially and 92% YOY.

8/15/17: Price stock offering of 3M shares at 22.75 (market price 22.70), total raised is 64M.

PIPELINE:

Omidria (pupil dilation during cataract surgery): Commercialized in US. Commercialized in EU on 7/23/18. Received permanent J-code from CMS on 7/24/19. Previous peak sales estimates were 100M (203K procedures x $492/procedure). With Omidria now being added to the VA formulary, this should add about 35M (65K-80K cataract surgeries are performed throughout VA system). On 7/27/18, Sandoz agreed to not request FDA approval for a generic version prior to patent expirty in 2033.'\n''\n'They are hoping that Omidria will eventually be covered by CMS without the need for pass-through status, given that its FDA approved for post-operative pain, and this fits CMSs criteria for coverage. 

Omidria had run into a big issue with the expiration of pass-through status on December 31, 2017. Since Congress did not extend the pass-through status from 3 to 5 years during the January 2018 continuing budget resolution, hospitals and surgery centers would not have been allowed to charge Medicare an extra $492 just for Omidria, on top of the $992 standard reimbursement rate for cataract surgery. Since Omidria is much more expensive than substitutes, the market expected sales to plummet (and 4Q17 sales began to show a slow-down). However, the March 2018 budget re-implemented pass-through status for another two years.
'\n'***SA comment says OMS721 will cost 250k-400k per patient (1). This is in line with the 500k cost of ALXNs Soliris, which targets aHUS, PNH, etc (other Orphan indications).***'\n''\n'OMS721 (HSCT-TMA): Phase 2. Breakthrough Designation for high-risk HSCT-TMA, Orphan drug (US/EU). Possibly the biggest opportunity of the pipeline. The current treatment is calcineurin inhibitor modification. Plasma therapy is also used but its very ineffective. Management cites some upcoming articles that say the cost per patient is 3M (and still very poor outcomes). Soliris is also used off-label (costs 500k/yr). If OMS 721 is successful, it could become the standard of care for every transplant in the Western world. Mortality rate 90%. 

Recent data showed it may be effective in severe GvHD (a complication of cell transplant patients), ability to target a specific arm which shows advantages over ALXNs Soliris, and potential to be effective therapy for those resistant to Soliris.

2/15/18: Positive interim data shows 19 patients treated experienced significant increase in median OS compared with historical control (347 days vs 21 days, p&lt;0.0001). Also, there were statistically significant improvements in a range of other biomarkers. Well-tolerated.'\n'
OMS721 (aHUS): Phase 3. Fast Track, Orphan (US). ALXNs Soliris (eculizumab) has been successful for treating PNH and aHUS (only approved treatment) but costs 600K/yr. 2018 sales projected at 3.4B. Infections are a very serious side effect, along with high blood pressure, UTI, nausea, and vomiting. Soliris requires weekly injections in the clinic for 5 weeks and then every other week thereafter (their subcutaneous formulation Ultomiris is approved for PNH and is still being tested for aHUS). OMS721 would be a self-administering subcutaneous treatment.

OMS721 (IgA Nephropathy): Phase 3. Also known as Bergers Disease. BTD, Orphan drug (US/EU). IgA is the most common primary glomerulopathy globally. US prevalence 120-180K cases/yr, accounting for 10% of all dialysis patients. 40% develop end-stage renal disease within 20 years of diagnosis. A common complication is high blood pressure. At the moment there is no cure, IgA currently has no approved treatment, and will be a billion dollar market. '\n''\n'Phase 2 results announced on 10/1/18 were positive in the sense that the treatment group showed the same level of proteinuria reduction as the previous cohort that was taking steroids (this cohort was not). However, there was no separation from placebo with the media proteinuria reduction coming in at 18.4% vs 18% for treatment vs placebo. Management did not comment on this in the press release, and there was no conference call held. However, after the initial 12-week dosing, patients could receive a dosing extension at investigator discretion, depending on the reduction from baseline. Four patients in this OMS721 dosing-extension period have reached between 9 and 12 months beyond baseline, and show reductions in proteinuria of 53.9 percent, 57.4 percent, 65.3 percent, and 67.8 percent. At most recent assessment, two of these four patients have continued to demonstrate sustained reductions in proteinuria for 2.5 and 5 months, respectively, after cessation of treatment with OMS721; the other two patients just recently completed treatment courses. Its unclear if the phase 3 listed on clinicaltrials.gov is the continuation of this phase 2 or if its a separate trial. But the phase 2 and 3 studies are powered for 24 weeks of treatment, so it could be that the patients just needed more dosing to separate from placebo. They did provide additional commentary at a conference the day after the press release, and management emphasized that the PR was very poorly worded. The purpose at 12 weeks was to show safety, and early signs post the 12 weeks are that the drug works well.'\n''\n'Patients take treatments to reduce HBP. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation in the glomerule. Immunosupressants (i.e. corticosteroids such as prednisone) are used to protect kidney function, but they have a range of side effects such as HBP, proteinuria, and swelling. FDA says one phase 3 with reduction in proteinuria as primary endpoint will suffice. Commences in February and will likely have readout late 2018/early 2019. Having surrogate primary endpoint of reduced proteinuria will likely save money, and is gives a good probability of success, as positive phase 2 results (3 out of 4 patients) were based on this same endpoint.

Summary:

LUXTURNA (voretigene neparvovec) (biallelic RPE65-mediated IRD*): NDA submitted. In mid-October the FDA's Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee unanimously recommended approval (16-0) of Luxturna. The PDUFA date was set for January 12th and results published in the Lancet were quite promising, with high statistical significance achieved in the primary endpoint (p=0.0013) and two secondary measures (p=0.0004, p=0.0059). There currently are no pharmacologic treatment options for people living with RPE65-mediated IRD, who in most cases progress to complete blindness. 

Conservative $500 million peak sales estimate. Has been priced at $425K/eye, so $850K/patient. Novartis has agreed to commercialize it ex-US for 105M upfront, 65M milestones, and royalties.

SPK-9001 (Hemophilia B): Phase 1/2. Collaboration with Pfizer.

SPK-8011 (Hemophilia A): Phase 1/2 results on seven patients treated with Sparks' SPK-8011 showed a 100% reduction in (calculated) annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and zero (calculated) annualized bleeds (n=1, though). Annualized infusion rate (AIR) was reduced 98% to a mean of 1.2.

Phase 1/2 data on BioMarin's valoctocogene roxaparvovec reduced both ABR and AIR to zero in six subjects. Given the slightly better results, ONCEs stock price dropped 35%. But its important to keep in mind that BMRN is 2-3 years ahead, and so was more comfortable testing a higher dose. ONCE will up the dosage as the study continues. Market large enough for several therapies.

SPK-7001: Choroideremia: Phase 1/2.

12/11/17: Down 35% after both ONCE and BMRN presented gene therapy hemophilia A data at a conference. Both results were great but ONCEs dose was very low and so results were slightly lower than BMRNs.",,3,6,113.48,0.00,0,0,0,0.00

PIPELINE:

DIAGNOSTICS

4KSCORE (prostate cancer test): More than 2M prostate biopsies per year worldwide. A 2015 Forbes article estimated 2B+ in peak sales (the cost at that time was $1K, so that implied 2M patients). Now the cost is $395. At about 70K tests/yr thats only 27.7M. Currently the only blood test that accurately identifies risk for aggressive prostate cancer. Initiating new sales plan in US and TV ads in Northeast. 40-55% cost savings by avoiding MRIs, biopsy, etc. On 3/16/18: Announce results from a long-term 20-year study that show the value of using 4Kscore blood test in men with abnormal PSA levels. The study showed that men with a low risk 4Kscore result of &lt;7.5% have a 0%, 0.6% (1 in 167), and 1.7% (1 in 59) risk of death from prostate cancer over the next 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. These men could have safely avoided a prostate biopsy, and with continued monitoring, would have further lowered their long-term risk.

CLAROS 1 (prostate specific antigen (PSA)): 25M PSA tests in US annually. 625M market size. Can test using single draw of blood from finger stick. It negates the need for a full blood draw or a centralized reference lab for many common tests. Completed clinical study for PSA test August 2017. Filing modular PMA with FDA for PSA test in 4Q17 and expect testosterone 510(k) filling in 2018.

CKD market size 12B (all stages), about 9M patients. Peak sales estimate 500M (1) - 700M (2). Up to 837M milestones, double digit royalties. At the moment Rayaldee only good option to treat stage 3-4 CKD. Stage 1 and 2 patients can usually recover by changing diet, exercising, etc. (3).

OPNT,41.33,41.33,2018-12-27,14.08,"1/13/21 8.51 OPNT QR: Cash 85M, pos. OPNT is a biotech focused on treatments for substance abuse and overdose. Narcan nasal spray (naloxone) (opioid overdose) has been on the market for several years and partner Emergent BioSolutions expects 2020 sales of around $300M. This nets OPNT a royalty of $27M, and this may vanish soon, as a judge ruled in favor of generic giant TEVA on 6/5/20 (3). The other interesting candidate is OPNT003, a nasal nalmafene spray also for opioid overdose, but possibly better suited than Narcan (due to Narcan's shorter half-life) to treat overdoses from synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. A senior VP at Emergent BioSolutions doesn't see OPNT003 replacing Narcan, but thinks it will have a place as a niche product. This SA author gives it an NPV of $50M (2). This value is a bit higher than the current market cap of $36M, but not by much, and the Narcan royalty may vanish soon. I am still perplexed why in the middle of an opioid crisis Narcan sales are not many times higher, but given the info we have, this cannot be a top pick. q4'\n' '\n'12/27/18 14.08 OPNT QR: Cash 25M, burn 1M. The royalty stream for Narcan nasal spray for opioid overdose is growing nicely. More and more states are considering legislation to have a prescription for it written along with any opioid prescription. It seems likely then that it will hit peak sales estimates of 250M+ (2017 sales were about 55M). OPNT gets a 12% royalty and gets to keep 90% of it (the other 10% goes to SWK). So the expected gross profit from Narcan nasal spray is 27M. The rest of the opioid/cannabis overdose pipeline is pre-phase 2, so while the sales could be very significant, it's too early stage to assign much value to. The thing that doesn't make this a screaming buy is the phase 2 trial for bulimia nervosa that reads out 1Q19. Naloxone is the active ingredient in the already-approved Narcan nasal spray, so they just jumped to a phase 2. Since I don't see any phase 1 results, I have nothing to go on as far as the probability of success for the phase 2 bulimia trial. I would pass.'\n''\n'CATALYSTS:'\n''\n''\n'VALUATION:'\n''\n''\n'LIQUIDITY:'\n''\n''\n'SEASONALITY: None.'\n''\n''\n'SUMMARY:'\n''\n''\n'EVENTS:'\n''\n''\n'PIPELINE:'\n''\n''\n'NARCAN NASAL SPRAY (opioid overdose): Approved.

Dropped another 15% on 2/1/18 when company revealed during earnings that SEC and DOJ investigations were underway. While it�s highly likely that the bribery accusations have some merit, obtaining government contracts through bribery is standard operating procedure in these places, and it doesn�t invalidate the solid revenue and earnings. Buy.   

Cash: 170M, pos

Catalysts: 

Summary: The crux of the Muddy Waters short thesis is that margins for security contracts (airport scanning, trucking cargo scanning, etc.) in Mexico, Albania, and Puerto Rico are being artificially inflated through bribery. They claim Mexico contract contributes 100M in EBITDA (which would be 50% of total EBITDA), and that with a new Mexican government likely coming in, the contract will not be renewed. They also claim to have interviewed insiders at OSIS and at the Mexican agency that awards the contracts, and that the insiders say OSIS is �rotten.� 

An analyst at Drexel Hamilton who has been covering OSIS for 15 years promptly came out and defended the company, saying Mexico contract contributes 120M to annual revenues (about 10% of total revenue) and only 30M in EBITDA.

The company filings don�t break down revenue by geographic segment, only by operating segment. The security division, at the center of this debate, generates about 124M per quarter, about 60% of total revenue. Regardless of the EBITDA debate, management has already previously stated that the Mexico contract would likely renew at a lower revenue run-rate. 

Using non-GAAP EPS guidance of 3.45-3.67, the current price of 55.65 gives a forward PE of 15. Not cheap, but the reaction to the Muddy Waters accusations seem like an overreaction. Even though some of the foreign contracts likely are inflated, the company�s operations are legitimate (the Albania contract has already been looked at by two separate Albanian governments and a European court). There is the risk of prosecution by a US agency for corrupt foreign practices, but even a legitimate company like Walmart has been found guilty of corruption in Mexico.     

2/1/18: 2Q18 earnings send stock down 15% on news that SEC and DOJ have initiated an investigation based on Muddy Waters accusations. Numbers themselves are great though. Revs 278M, +14% YOY.

But a parallel phase 3 in Europe met endpoints in November 2017. A follow-up phase 3 in the US is being run, and while the market does not like the 18-month wait, the positive results from Europe make this a good bet. However, there are no data readouts until 1H20. On 8/6/18 they announced a co-promotion agreement for AOE drug Otividex, but no financials were disclosed. OTIC had discontinued marketing Otividex on its own because of weak sales, so this will likely not bring in much revenue, and likely not move the stock. This seems like a perfect candidate for short sellers to target given the lack of major catalysts for over a year.

SUMMARY:'\n''\n'EVENTS:'\n''\n'8/6/18: +10%. Announces Otiprio co-promotion agreement with Mission Pharma for AOE indication. OTIC will receive an annual co-promotion fee and a share of gross profits, but no specific financials were disclosed.

PIPELINE:

Otiprio (ear tube surgery): Commercialized 2016. Global peak sales estimates were 150M for ear tube surgery and 200-300M for all indications (1), but 2017 sales were only 1.2M. Still available but the company is not supporting it. On 8/6/18 they licensed it to Mission Pharma for an annual co-promotion fee and a share of gross profits, but financials were not disclosed. We should not expect much from this drug.

Otiprio (acute otitis externa (AOE) = swimmers ear): Approved March 2018. US cases of AOE 4M/yr.

Phase 3 reported significant increase in cure rate compared to placebo after a week of treatment (70% vs 49%, p&lt;.001).

Otiprio (acute otitis media with tubes (AOMT)): Phase 2 complete.

Otividex (Menieres disease): AVERTS-2 Phase 3 complete. This tril was conducted in the EU. When they announced the results in November 2017, shares jumped 130% on achieving the primary endpoint of reduction in the number of vertigo days compared to placebo (reduction of 6.2 vertigo days after 3 months vs 3.7 days, p=0.029).

Otividex (Menieres disease): AVERTS-1 Phase 3 complete. US prevalence 600K. Cowen analyst says US market opportunity 500M (2). SA author says it will cost 1K/treatment, so 4K/yr (every 3 months) (6). However, its unclear if 600K is the entire addressable market. The Massachusetts Eye and Ear Insititute reports that 90-95% of patients are able to reduce vertigo to a manageable level through stress management, dietary restrictions (low sodium intake), diuretics (relieves fluid build-up in inner ear) and vestibular suppressants, which would mean that only 5-10% resort to more invasive procedures such as ear injections or surgeries (5). But a survey in the UK of 800 patients showed that about 25% had tried steroid injections (7).'\n''\n''\n'Otividex is a sustained-exposure formulation of the steroid dexamethasone, which is commonly used to treat Menieres disease. When otividex is injected into the ear as a liquid, it becomes a viscous gel, designed to stay in the inner ear longer. Current dexamethasone injections involve many repeat injections. Patients are also restricted from moving or swallowing for up to thirty minutes once the steroid is taken, to ensure the drug stays in the inner ear. '\n''\n'The antibiotic gentamicin is also a common treatment that is very effective at reducing the number of vertigo days. However, with older doses of 4/month, 20% of patients experience hearing loss from gentamicin injections. A newer lower dose of 1-2/month seems to work just as well without the damaging side effects (8). A study published in 2011 showed that low-dose gentamicin injections achieved better outcomes vs dexamethasone injections, with a very low incidence of hearing deterioration. In the gentamicin group, complete control of vertigo (class A) was achieved in 26 patients (81%) and substantial control of vertigo (class B) in 4 patients (12.5%). In the dexamethasone group, class A was achieved in 12 (43%), and class B in 5 (18%) patients. In the gentamicin group, 4 patients showed a reduction in PTA of 10 dB. In the ITD group, PTA was unchanged or slightly improved in 16 patients (belonging to class A-B) and worse in 12. However, we dont have access to the full article and so dont know exactly how many days of vertigo reduction were observed (4).'\n''\n''\n'The steroid methylprednisolone has also shown itself to be efficacious. A 2016 study in The Lancet (2 total injections, the second 2 weeks after the first), showed that in a head to head match-up with gentamicin, the results were nearly identical. In the gentamicin group, the mean number of vertigo attacks in the final 6 months compared with the 6 months before the first injection (primary outcome) decreased from 199 (SD 167) to 25 (58) in the gentamicin group (87% reduction) and from 164 (125) to 16 (34) in the methylprednisolone group. This is equivalent to about a 16 vertigo day reduction over 6 months, which would equat to about an 8 vertigo day reduction over 3 moths. Both drugs were well tolerated with no safety concerns, though the steroid group could hear speech a bit more clearly (9).'\n''\n''\n'In the AVERTS-2 study that was a success in the EU, otividex showed a clinical benefit by demonstrating a 6.2 day reduction in the mean reported number of DVD from baseline to Month 3 with a 2.5 day mean difference between OTIVIDEX and placebo in Month 3 (10). These results do not seem that incredible compared to the 8 vertigo day reduction mentioned above.'\n''\n'Management believes one additional phase 3 should be sufficient for NDA submission in US. This trial will start mid-2018 (and will last approx. 18 months) and will have the same endpoints as previous trial, but will focus on eliminating increased patient and clinician expectations to limit placebo effect. On 8/30/17, it dropped from 20 to 3 after failing to achieve primary endpoint and any secondary endpoints. Reason given is higher than normal placebo response in US from increased expectations (53% vs 40-43% normally). Clinicians in US likely communicated excellent phase 2 results to patients, which accounted for raised expectations. Also, sites in Europe were academic settings with no financial motivation to recruit patients. This may have also played a role in the higher than expected placebo response.'\n'
OTO-313 (tinnitus): Phase 1 complete. Tinnitus is the perception of sound without an external stimulus. Market size 16M in US. No safety concerns. Initiate phase 1/2 1H19.

OTO-413 (repair of synaptopathy = hidden hearing loss): Hidden hearing loss is an inability to hear against background noise. Market size 2.9% of US population.

OTO-5XX (cisplatin-induced hearing loss): Market size 500K patients treated with platinum-induced chemo each year in US. 2H18 select candidate for development.

OTO-6XX (ear hair cell regeneration): Market size 6.6M patients with severe hearing loss in US. 2H18 select candidate for development.'\n''\n''\n'SOURCES:'\n''\n'1. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3781236-long-case-otonomy'\n'2. https://www.reuters.com/article/us-otonomy-study-idUSKCN1BA1E1'\n'3. http://www.otonomy.com/pipeline/otividex/'\n'4. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0194599811429432'\n'5. https://www.masseyeandear.org/for-patients/patient-guide/patient-education/diseases-and-conditions/menieres-disease'\n'6. https://seekingalpha.com/article/3781236-long-case-otonomy'\n'7. https://www.mindovermenieres.com/success-rates-of-menieres-disease-treatments/'\n'8. https://www.dizziness-and-balance.com/disorders/menieres/menieres%20last%20resort.html'\n'9. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)31461-1/fulltext'\n'10. http://investors.otonomy.com/static-files/2b7ed6d7-7056-48e2-ad6c-f5aeace058e9",,3,6,6.47,2.44,0,0,0,0.40

As a result, our profit from these operations is seasonal, with the fourth quarter accounting for as much as almost half our annual profits and the first quarter possibly resulting in a loss. Moreover, due to the long receivable cycle and shorter payable cycle, this seasonality puts strains on our cash flow through the first and second quarter of every year. These factors could adversely impact our cash flow and our ability to meet our financial debt covenants.'\n''\n'SUMMARY: 

EVENTS:'\n''\n'12/7/20 BO: +15%. Raise FY20 guidance from 295M to 313M and adj EBITDA from 26M to 31M. The acceleration of Perions advertising revenue growth is being driven by higher-than-expected revenue synergies from recent acquisitions, as well as higher demand across our CTV and video offerings, commented Doron Gerstel, Perions CEO. Additionally, following the four-year renewal of our partnership with Microsoft, announced earlier this quarter, we see an increased number of publishers who wish to engage with Perions search business unit. These achievements underscore the success of our diversification strategy and are expected to contribute to double-digit revenue growth rates over the coming years for Perion. I have already included the additional EBITDA contributions from the acquisitions in the model so this news does not change our PT of $9.00. Move from q1 (C) to pass (E).'\n''\n'10/28/20: +2%. 3Q20.

They are paying down debt and they slightly raised the midpoint of annual EBITDA guidance so there was nothing particularly bad about the results. I think its down just because it was overvalued before after the big run-up. The forward PE continues to be about 10, with consensus EPS expected to grow 40% next year. But without a very deep look into Undertone and their other digital branding products (and 2020 revs guidance), its difficult to know whether such a high EPS growth is believable or not. Move from q3 to q4. cp 41k. tp 37k. q4 tp 26k.'\n''\n'8/7/19 BO: +15%. 2Q19. Solid beat on top and bottom. Raised adj EBITDA guidance. Advertising revs continues to decline but Search revs grew at 42% yoy. Investors also liked that they are paying down debt instead of doing acquisitions (so far). The forwad PE for 2020 is 10, with EPS expected to grow at about 30%. A $6+/share PT seems fair, so I would move from q3 to q4 since we are approaching the PT. q4. cp 54k. tp 43k.'\n''\n'7/9/19: +7%.

Its a bit perplexing because they again say that there is more demand than they have inventory for their high-value ad units. The reason 2019 adj EBITDA will be so much lower is because they are increasing spending on RD to develop better technology to fill these higher-value ad units. they do not want to fill the gap in the short-term with a lower-value product which would erode margins. Using the lower adj EBITDA for 2019, the forward PE is 12. The cash situation is still good (with more cash than total debt), but with the lower forward PE, it doesnt seem like such a screaming buy anymore. Ill listen to the call at 1000, but I wouldnt add yet. maybe this should move from q2 to q5. cp 39k. q2 tp 74k. q5 tp 28k'\n''\n'11/1/18: -10%. 3Q18 beat on top and bottom. They repaid 21M worth of debt through 3 quarters, and for the first time in 4 years, they have a net positive cash position. They also reaffirmed full-year EBITDA guidance of 28-32M. The reason its down is perhaps because advertising revs is down -17% yoy after only being down -6% for 2Q18. They continue to experience problems with not having enough publishers that can publish their high-quality, high-impact ad units within the current programmatic environment. The current capacity of publishers that can place our unique units is less than the demand we have, so we have campaigns that are not being fully delivered. We are actively working with our programmatic partners to address this issue and I am confident that we will close the current gap to better serve programmatic ready Undertone high-impact ad units in 2019. This will enable us to have access to the quality supply we need to drive revenues. This still seems very undervalued.'\n''\n'8/9/18: -3%. 2Q18 saw adj net income of 4.7M. And they raised full-year adj EBITDA guidance from 28-32M to 29-32M. The concern is what they will do with their excess cash. On the call, analysts were asking for paying down debt, share buybacks, or dividends. Management instead said M&amp;A. Also, after 1Q18 saw the first sequential increase in search revs in 5 quarters, this quarter saw a sequential decline again.'\n''\n'5/10/18: +23%. 1Q18 adj net income 3M.

3/15/18: 4Q17 revs 77M, -9% YOY. Adjusted net income 6.4M vs 6.5M. Adjusted EBITDA 11.9M vs 13.5M.

Revenues continue to fall, but the search segment may have finally bottomed. They extended their agreement with Bing until 2020, and this encouraged new partners to join their network. After five consecutive quarters, they are reporting sequential growth, with search revs of 34.3M vs 33.3M sequentially.

Move from q2 (0.85%) to q4 (0.55%).'\n''\n'2/20/20 BO: +10%. PGNX and LNTH agree to amend transaction terms. Each PGNX shareholder will now receive 0.31 of a share of LNTH, increased from 0.2502 under the Original Agreement. With LNTH trading at $16.24/share, that values PGNX at $5.03/share (so basically where it is after todays jump). PGNX shareholders will also get a non-tradeable CVR that is payable in two separate cash payments if PyLTM (18F-DCFPyL) exceeds net sales thresholds of $100 million in 2022 and $150 million in 2023 (the amount of the cash payment was not disclosed). As a result of the increase in the exchange ratio, following the completion of the merger, former PGNX shareholders ownership stake will increase to approximately 40% of the combined company from approximately 35% under the terms set forth in the Original Agreement. LNTH has also agreed to make available to PGNX up to $10 million of bridge financing. The merger transaction is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2020. While the exchange ratio is more favorable, the price of LNTH has come down so much that the new valuation for PGNX is much less than the $6.01/share valuation from 10/2/19. After all the effort Velan went through to get new management in place, if this is all they think the company is worth, then I guess there wasnt much value there to begin with.

PGNX shareholders receive 0.2502 shares of LNTH for each share they own. LNTH closed at $24.03/share yesterday, so that would imply a value of $6.01/share for PGNX. PGNX closed at $4.95/share yesterday, so the offer represents a premium of 21%. The exchange ratio implies 35% ownership for PGNX shareholders, and cost savings of $15M-$20M are expected by 2022 (primarily from G&amp;A). The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. The proposed offer has been unanimously approved by the BOD of both companies, implying that PGNXs BOD think $6.01/share is fair value for the stock.

PIPELINE:

RELISTOR (opioid induced constipation (OIC)): Commercialized. Licensed to VRX and receives a 15-19% royalty. An August 5, 2016 Bloomberg article mentioned that Relistor had attracted interest from other drugmakers and that VRX could get 400-500M. PGNX has said peak sales could be 1B, but Evercore says 250M is more likely (FierceBiotech). The drug competes with AZNs/Daiichis Movantik tablets, which were approved by the FDA and MAA on 9/16/14 and 12/9/14, respectively. So far AZN has paid NKTR 395M upfront, and NKTR is also entitled to up to $375M in sales milestones plus significant double-digit royalty payments starting at 20% of net sales in the U.S. and 18% of net sales in the EU and rest of world.

PyL PET (prostate cancer imaging agent): Phase 3 complete 12/23/19. Licensed to Curium for the EU on 1/3/19 (Curium responsible for all costs. Royalties to PGNX not disclosed). Reported mixed results on 10/5/18 for phase 2/3 but good results for phase 3 on 12/23/19. No safety issues. Conventional scan methods such as MRI, fluoroscopy, CAT scan, X-ray, and ultrasound only provide anatomical imaging. These methods have limited utility in patients at early stages of disease when gross anatomical changes are not yet evident, in patients who have undergone surgical procedures to treat their disease and anatomy is difficult to assess, or in patients who have systemic disease where the precise locations are unknown (2). Company claims that molecular imaging is much more useful. Competing PET molecular imaging agent Axumin (US approval 5/27/16, EU approval 5/22/17) proved effective at getting 64% of patients to get their cancer management plan changed post-scan (3). Axumin had sales of $140M in 2019 (4), however, its not clear that PyL has better results. One difference is that Axumin is used to scan men with suspected recurrence due to PSA levels while PyL is a PSMA-targeted agent, but its not clear what this means in terms of efficacy. PGNX reported a CLR of of 84.8% to 87.0% among the three blinded independent readers (the lower bound of the 95% confidence intervals ranging from 77.8% to 80.4%) (5). On average, the readers correctly predicted the biopsy results for 77% of the images (range: 75%79%) (6). It would seem like PGNXs percentage is higher but I dont think CLR and predicting biopsy results are the exact same thing. At the moment I dont think we have any reason to conclude that PGNXs PyL is better.'\n''\n''\n'1095 (prostate cancer): Phase 2.

Azedra (rare adrenal cancer): Approved on 7/31/18. Has Orphan, Fast Track, Breakthrough, and Priority Review status. Estimated incidence of paraganglioma is 2-8 cases/1M, so overall new cases per year is 646-2,584. Will cost 300K/yr, and SA author estimates peak sales of 150M (1). 

The excerpt below is from SA and discusses the hotly debated trial results, and whether the primary endpoint included both the single- and double-dose arms, or just the double-dose arms. But basically, the drug is clearly effective with double-doses, and NDA acceptance and eventual approval is likely given that the trial met the SPA set by the FDA, which is rarely rescinded. 

Molecular Insights Phase IIa study included 41 patients. Seven of these were treated with one dose of Azedra, while 34 received two doses. Among the one-dose cohort, only one patient (14.3% of cohort) responded sufficiently to meet the requirements of the primary endpoint, namely a 50% reduction in hypertensive medication for six months. Of the two-dose cohort, 12 of the 34 patients responded (35.3% of cohort). This means that, among all patients in the Phase IIa trial, 31.7% responded to Azedra.

The Phase IIb trial included 27 patients, with 11 receiving one dose of Azedra and 16 receiving two. No one in the one-dose cohort responded (0% of cohort), while four responded (25% of cohort). Thus, among all patients in the Phase IIb trial, 14.8% responded to Azedra.

The imbalance in overall response is what has caused particular consternation. Yet it should be expected that, for a drug that is expected to require two doses (as is stated in the SPA) to be effective, a trial arm with a smaller proportion of patients receiving two doses would almost of necessity show worse blended results. Still, the two-dose cohort\'s 25% response rate in the second trial arm is significantly worse than the 35.3% response rate of the same cohort in the firstthe Phase IIb trial\'s two-dose cohort, despite under-performing by comparison to the first trial arm, still saw a 25% response rate, meeting the requirement laid out by the SPA.'\n''\n''\n'GLOSSARY:'\n'CLR: correct localization rate'\n'CVR: contingent value right'\n''\n'SOURCES:'\n'1.https://seekingalpha.com/article/4194278-progenics-q2-earnings-outlook'\n'2. <a href=""https://www.progenics.com/product-pipeline/progenics-small-molecule-diagnostic-pyl/"" style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">https://www.progenics.com/product-pipeline/progenics-small-molecule-diagnostic-pyl/</a>'\n'3. <a href=""http://www.blueearthdiagnostics.com/results-from-blue-earth-diagnostics-falcon-trial-show-64-of-patients-with-suspected-recurrent-prostate-cancer-had-change-in-management-following-axumin-fluciclovine-f-18-pet-ct-scan/"" style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">http://www.blueearthdiagnostics.com/results-from-blue-earth-diagnostics-falcon-trial-show-64-of-patients-with-suspected-recurrent-prostate-cancer-had-change-in-management-following-axumin-fluciclovine-f-18-pet-ct-scan/</a>'\n'4. <a href=""https://corporate.bracco.com/gb-en/press-room/bracco-imaging-expands-portfolio-personalized-diagnostics-acquisition-blue-earth-diagnostics"" style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">https://corporate.bracco.com/gb-en/press-room/bracco-imaging-expands-portfolio-personalized-diagnostics-acquisition-blue-earth-diagnostics</a>'\n'5. <a href=""https://ir.progenics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/progenics-pharmaceuticals-announces-phase-3-condor-trial-pyltm"" style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">https://ir.progenics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/progenics-pharmaceuticals-announces-phase-3-condor-trial-pyltm</a>'\n'6. <a href=""https://www.axumin.com/about/efficacy"" style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">https://www.axumin.com/about/efficacy</a>",,3,6,4.27,4.21,0,0,0,0.85

But managements plan to draw in more customers and capture more spending through new virtual reality games (set to launch mid-2018) and a revamped drink and food menu (100% Angus burgers) isnt very convincing. 1Q18 on 6/11/18 saw a solid beat on the top and bottom line, which sent the stock up +13% AH, but comps came in at -4.9%. Without positive comps, PLAY is simply growing revenues through more store openings. Using management guidance for 2018, the forward PE is 18, and using the consensus 2019 EPS estimates, the forward PE is 21. Stock buybacks and an earnings beat may have lifted PLAY recently, but with management unable to provide a clear answer as to why they are losing market share, this is still a pass. Rank 10.

SUMMARY: PLAY operates in the dining &amp; entertainment segment. Their bar/dining area offers drinks and bar-type food, and their entertainment area offers full-size arcade games, basketball shooting games, air hockey, etc. During the 4Q17 call, an analyst asked who they are losing market share to (Netflix, movies, shopping, golf/sports, online gaming, etc.). Management could not come up with a clear answer, and seemed to indicate its all of the above. 

Their plan to regain positive comps through virtual reality games (being introduced mid-2018) and a revamped drink and food menu (more happy hour specials, less items, more food-to-go) arent convincing. They dont have any proprietary games that are specific to them, so they dont have a core audience of hard core gamers that will always be loyal.

July 2018: Beginning of decline from $80/share. Market begins to re-value PLT after shares ran up post-Polycom-acquisition announcement. This SA author (1) correctly predicted that the $2B Polycom acquisition would go down as one of the worst M&amp;A transactions of this cycle (integration did not end up going well). Their bearishness was based on the fact that PE firm Siris bought Polycom for $2B less than two years ago but decided it wanted out and exited with basically no gain and very little stock in the combined company. New players such as Cisco are also moving into PLTs space.

PRTK has two commercialized antibiotics in NUZYRA (ABSSSI and CABP) and SEYSARA (acne vulgaris). SEYSARA was launched in January 2019 and as of 3Q20 the royalties to PRTK are less than $1M. Peak sales estimates range from $150M - $500M (3), with PRTK getting a 10% royalty, but as of now this does not look like it will be a material contributor. NUZYRA was launched in February 2019 and as of 3Q20 had sales of $11M (+35% qoq), so it is thus far having a much more successful launch compared to other failed antibiotics such as AKAO's Zemdri (2, slide 13). This SA author (4) thinks the 3 reasons it might be differentiating itself are: 1) being efficacious for both ABSSSI and CABP, 2) being available in both oral and IV formulations, and 3) having a clean label with no significant SAEs. These reasons seem valid, and the $285M contract with BARDA (5), of which $128M in potentially available funding remains, could be extended into something very meaningful should the government wish to stockpile mass quantities of NUZYRA for use against potential biothreats. Of all the companies in the antibiotics space that I've looked at, this one seems the most promising. But it's too early to tell if NUZYRA will reach hundreds of millions in sales.

It causes your bone marrow to make too many red blood cells. These excess cells thicken your blood, slowing its flow, which may cause serious problems, such as blood clots. Many patients with PV need regular phlebotomy in order to keep hematocrit levels below 45%. Otherwise, they are at a much higher risk of thrombosis and cardiovascular complications. The mainstay of treatment is frequent phlebotomy, but it is expensive and labor-intensive, and it exacerbates iron deficiency. Cytoreductive therapies like hydroxyurea are used off-label, but it is essentially a chemotherapy agent which can cause vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, infertility and more. Jakafi is the only approved drug (for hydroxyurea-intolerant patients) but is also cytoreductive and can cause side effects such as bruising, dizziness, headache, and diarrhea (1).'\n''\n'Very promising early results on 5/7/20. '\n''\n'PTG-200 (Crohns disease): Phase 2. A first-in-class oral peptide IL-23R antagonist, a pathway that has been successfully blocked by injectable antibodies. Licensed to Janssen on 5/30/17. Janssen paid $50M upfront and up to $990M in milestones plus double-digit royalties. Development costs will be shared through phase 2.'\n''\n'PN-943 (UC): Phase 1 complete. Announced on 5/7/20 that initiation of phase 2 will be put on hold dut to COVID-19 and that resources will be focused on PTG-300.

PTG-100 (ulcerative colitis (UC)): Phase 2 PROPEL terminated due to futility. An oral, alpha-4-beta-7 integrin-specific antagonist that binds to a protein called MAdCAM-1 that resides in the GI tract that acts as a homing receptor for white blood cells called lymphocytes.

PIPELINE:

Remoxy ER (painkiller): Will likely be discontinued. Remoxy ER is a proprietary oral formulation of oxycodone. A 2014 Motley Fool article put peak sales estimates at 1.5B (1). The drug is licensed from Durect. PTIE paid DURECT an upfront license fee of $1.0 million, with the potential for an additional $3.0 million in performance milestone payments based on the successful development and approval of REMOXY ER. Of these potential milestones, $1.5 million has been paid to DURECT. DURECT will also receive royalties for REMOXY ER, if commercialized, of 6.0% to 11.5% of net sales of the product, depending on sales volume.'\n''\n'Since 2008, the drug has been through multiple CRLs, extra trials, etc. Pfizer ended the partnership in 2014, but likely because they figured it would be more financially beneficial to pursue their own abuse-deterrent opioid rather than pay royalties to PTIE and manufacturing fees to MNK.'\n''\n''\n'On 8/6/18, it dropped 40% from another CRL. The FDA says that the benefits do not outweight the risks. Management says this decision is bizarre and seems to be ideologically driven, given the pressing need for a less addictive opioid, and the fact that the additional trials all met FDA requirements.'\n''\n''\n'After meeting with the FDA, they released the meeting minutes on 3/20/17, confirming two requirements are needed for the resubmission of the REMOXY NDA:1) To conduct a clinical abuse potential study via the intranasal route of abuse; and 2) To conduct a non-clinical abuse potential study using household solvents.

On 1/9/17, they reported statistically significant results (p&lt;.01) for the nasal-abuse trial requested from the 2nd CRL. They met the primary endpoint, showing that non-dependent recreational opioid users who snorted Remoxy ER reported reduced drug liking compared to immediate-release oxycodone. The data also showed that nasal administration of REMOXY ER resulted in lower exposure to oxycodone, lower peak concentrations and longer time to peak drug concentration than comparable drugs.'\n''\n'On 9/26/16, they received their 2nd CRL for Remoxy ER. The CRL focuses on the abuse-deterrent properties of REMOXY ER and proposed drug labeling.  The CRL makes no mention of clinical safety, drug efficacy, manufacturing, stability, bioequivalence or any other issues from a prior Complete Response Letter.  The CRL specifies additional actions that are needed in order to obtain approval of REMOXY ER with label claims against three routes of abuse (i.e., injection, inhalation and snorting).  These actions may take approximately a year to conduct and may cost approximately $5MM.'\n'

CATALYSTS: 4Q18 (andexxa CHMP decision)

VALUATION: PT 53.50 (consensus)

SUMMARY: The risk here is that the FDA asks for an additional Andexxa trial with two arms. The previous trial had been conducted with a single treatment arm. But both management and analysts have pointed out that praxbind, another blood-thinning reversal agent, was approved without a double-arm trial. Given the high mortality rates of this patient population, a placebo arm doesnt make sense, and so there seems to be consensus that the present data is sufficient for approval.

EVENTS:

5/4/18: +30%. FDA approves Andexxa.

9/13/17: Price stock offering at 55/share (about market price, but had been trading above 60/share before offering announced).

PIPELINE:

Bevyxxa (venous thromboembolism (VTE)): FDA approved, commercial launch Jan 2018. CHMP gives thumbs down on 3/23/18, citing lack of enough data. It did not consider the results from the main study to be reliable because some data were not available. Company will appeal. 

Addressable market 3-4B (management estimate). In G7 countries, 24M acute medical patients indicated for VTE prevention, and 1M will suffer a blood clot within 35 days. Bayer has given Xarelto peak sales estimates of 5.3B. 

Fast Track, Priority Review. An oral, factor Xa inhibitor, and the only drug approved for this indication. Is the first therapy to demonstrate a reduction in the incidence of VTE without a significant increase in major bleeding.

Favorable safety profile in terms of reducing VTE, and also at 600/yr, it costs a lot less than eliquis (4.4K/yr), entresto (4.5K/yr), and repatha (10K/yr). 

6/23/18: FDA approves bevyxxa.

Andexxa (acute major bleeding while on Factor Xa inhibitor therapy): FDA approves on 5/4/18. EU advisory group gives positive recommendation on 2/21/18. Breakthrough designation. 100% ownership rights ex-Japan. Addressable market 2B+ (management estimate). 440K G7 bleeding admissions due to oral factor Xa inhibitor (27% CAGR), with mortality at 30 days 38-45%.

Praxbind is a reversal agent specifically for anticoagulant Pradaxa. In 2013 praxbind had annual sales of 800M.

Andexxa has the potential to be the first universal FXa inhibitor antidote/reversal agent. This drug is designed to reverse major bleeding caused by bevyxxa, xarelto, eliquis, savaysa, lovenox, arixtra, and unfractionated heparin. 

The comments on SA seem to indicate the urgent need for andexxas approval given the high mortality rate in this space. Even if its approved with a label saying only for ICH, it could be prescribed off-label.

3/12/18: Down 9% on new follow-up interim data from phase 3b/4. Data is good, but market was hoping for stellar data to rest easier about FDA not requiring another trial. Results from 132 patients showed 83% rate of good/excellent hemostasis (bleeding stopped) over a 12-hour period post-infusion. Blood clotting events occurred in 11% of patients and 12% died (this is not unusual given mortality risk of population). Data is consistent with previously released results. 

3/1/18: Down 25%. During 4Q17 earnings call, CEO says midway through Oh by the way, the FDA sent a letter asking for more data (other than usual care cohort) for andexxa PDUFA. The market takes this as a delay. 

12/26/17: FDA will extend its review of andexxa by 90 days to 5/4/18. Company says has submitted additional data.

Acquired worldwide rights (except EU, Canada, and Israel) from AZN on 2/25/20 for $50M. 2019 sales were $98M (-10%) (18, pg 71). In December 2018, AZN had initiated legal proceedings against some generic manufacturing companies claiming that if their generic version of Movantik were approved and marketed, it would infringe on AZNs patents. A trial had been set for March 2021 (18, pg 222).

RIZAPORT: together with IntelGenx Corp has submitted NDA.'\n''\n'MYTESI (diarrhea): Co-promotiong agreement with Napo Pharma announced on 6/28/18. Commercialized on 7/25/18. Mytesi is for the symptomatic relief of non-infectious diarrhea in adults with HIV/AIDS on anti-retroviral therapy (ART).'\n''\n'AEMCOLO (Travelers Diarrhea): Marketed. US approval 2018. Contains rifamycin SV formulated with the MMX technology. Was successful in Trial 1 (superiority vs placebo) and also Trial 2 (non-inferiority vs active comparator ciprofloxacin). AEMCOLO has basically shown itself to be non-inferior to the current gold standard ciprofloxacin, with a very slightly worse tolerability profile (3.3% vs 1.9% headache incidence), but possibly a more favorable profile with respect to generating drug resistance. This was measured via colonization rates of ESBL E. coli bacteria in a post-hoc analysis (7% ciprofloxacin vs 0% AEMCOLO), but would require a full post-marketing study to confirm (5, 6, 7). Other TD drugs such as Xifaxan and Cipro have reached blockbuster status, but the problem is they are approved for many indications, some of which are likely larger markets than TD. Considering that RDHL did not technically make an upfront payment to Cosmo for the US rights (Cosmo paid $12M in exchange for an equity stake), I dont think the contribution for AEMCOLO will be very material.'\n''\n'RHB-104 (Crohns disease): Phase 3 US MAP 1 complete. RHB-104 is a patent protected combination of 3 antibiotics (clarithromycin, clofazimine and rifabutin) in a single oral capsule. There is a growing body of evidence that MAP bacterial infections are the underlying cause of Crohns Disease. The US MAP 1 phase 3 trial was significant because it demonstrated the efficacy of anti-MAP therapy in Crohns disease (current therapies only target the inflammation associated with Crohns). RDHL aims to differentiate itself from current treatments by targeting the MAP bacteria. From the US MAP I phase 3 results, management thinks RHB-104 can become the first-line of care as a monotherapy, and then be used as a combo therapy with immunosuppressives or parenteral biologics. However, they did not run a head-to-head trial vs SOC and so we only have the historical comparison across trials (11).'\n''\n'RHB-104 (Crohns disease): Phase 3 US MAP 2. Enrollment completed with 54 patients.

RHB-104 (nontuberculous mycobacteria): phase 3

TALICIA (RHB-105) (H. pylori infection): Approved 11/4/19. Will launch in US 1Q20. Fast track, QIDP, 6-month priority review, 8 years market exclusivity. TALICIA is a combination of 3 approved drugs: omeprazole, amoxicillin and rifabutin. TALICIA is the first and only FDA approved rifabutin-based pylori therapy and is designed to address the high and growing bacterial resistance and diminished efficacy (failure rates 25%-40%) of clarithromycin-based standard-of-care therapy. However, this source from 2017 says that rates of resistance for clarithromycin are only 4%-15%. H. pylori resistance rates to another SOC, metronidazole, are a bit higher at 29% to 41% (9, pg 3). Metronidazole also carries carcinogenic warning. The recent phase 3 announced on 12/3/18 showed that Talicia&nbsp;has better efficacy (84% vs 58%) than active comparator (amoxicillin + omeprazole), but the active comparator did not include clarithromycin, the key ingredient in one of the current SOC therapies Prevpac. While 84% is good, efficacy rates for most FDA-approved treatments are 75%+, so its not a game-changing result (9, pg 10). They did announce results on 3/8/16 from a prior phase 3 that were positive, but it was against historical SOC and not an actual head-to-head trial (10). After taking a deeper look at TALICIA it just doesnt seem like a slam dunk given the history of antibiotics performing poorly and the lack of a true head-to-head trial.'\n''\n'Management thinks there are some good reasons why it will become the standard of care. Treatment is 4 all-in-one capsules every 8 hours for 14 days, so its the only treatment that doesnt require combining pills. Its for a much broader population than other antibiotics. Given that its a combo of amoxicillin + rifabutin + omeprazole, sudden resistance seems unlikely, as resistance to amoxicillin and rifabutin is very rare. The overarching concern with all new antibiotics is that physicians will be reluctant to use them for fear of triggering a new wave of resistance (i.e. AKAO). But management says that the ACG guidelines already say that first-line treatment of clarithromycin triple therapy should be confined to patients with no previous history of macrolide exposure who reside in areas where clarithromycin resistance amongst H. pyloriisolates is known to be low (about 35% of Americans have been prescribed a macrolide) (8). '\n''\n'BEKINDA (RHB-102) (gastroenteritis/gastritis): Designing a confirmatory phase 3. Positive results from first phase 3 GUARD study announced June 2017 (14). Bekinda is a proprietary, oral, extended-release (24 hours), once-daily pill formulation of the antiemetic drug ondansetron. Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 (serotonin) receptor antagonist which is marketed under various trade names including GSKs Zofran, which had 2002 global sales of $1.4B (13). 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are considered the most effective and significant class of drugs in prevention of nausea and vomiting. If approved by FDA, RHB-102 could become the first 5-HT3 antiemetic drug indicated for the treatment of acute gastroenteritis or gastritis in the U.S. Patients presenting at hospitals with gastroenteritis and gastritis are often treated primarily in IV administration with antiemetic drugs not indicated or approved for this condition, off-label, including 5-HT3 serotonin receptor inhibitors. There are tons of drugs available for stomach flu, so I wont spend time looking at other results. Again, the results vs placebo are positive, but it begs the question why they did not test it against another approved therapy.'\n''\n'BEKINDA (RHB-102) (IBS-D): Phase 2 successfully met primary endpoint (but not secondary) for treatment of IBS-D, but was not a home run (absolute difference of 20.7% vs placebo). Initial results were announced on 10/3/17 (15) and final results on 1/6/18 (16). The results compare favorably with previously reported efficacy outcomes from two Phase 3 studies of Salixs (BHC) Xifaxan (10.5% difference) and two Phase 3 studies of AGNs Viberzi (13.5% difference). Management says: The theoretical comparison between the BEKINDA 12 mg Phase II study results and published data from studies of IBS-D-approved therapies Xifaxan and Viberzi serves as a general benchmark for the effect size observed with BEKINDA 12 mg and should not be construed as a direct and/or equal comparison given that the studies were not identical in design, patient population and treatment duration and were not conducted head-to head in the same patient population. Current treatments have lots of tolerability issues (17), so has a chance to become the standard of care. But again, why didnt they do a head-to-head comparison?'\n''\n'RHB-106 (bowel cleanser): Phase 2/3 studies planned. Regained worldwide rights from Salix on 1/2/20. Improved safety over existing encapsulated preparations on the market. No need to consume liquid solution; No bad taste.  '\n''\n'RHB-204 (pulmonary NTM infections): Pivotal phase 3 planned for mid-2020. Fast Track. QIDP. Oral, first-line treatment. RHB-204 is a patented fixed-dose combination product of three antibiotics intended to simplify administration and optimize compliance. Each capsule contains the same three antibiotics as RHB-104 (clarithromycin, clofazimine, and rifabutin), but at doses unique from RHB-104. Effective treatment of NTM caused by MAC requires three drugs for at least 12 months of treatment. Currently recommended treatment regimens, drug resistance patterns, and treatment outcomes differ according to the NTM species, and management is a lengthy complicated process with limited therapeutic options. Although each of the three components of RHB-204 is approved individually and has been tested extensively in humans (e.g. see RHB-104), the formulation and doses represented by RHB-204 have not been tested.

This data analytics and risk management spin-off of COGT (now FLNT) has begun trading with 20M in cash, no debt, and should have positive adjusted EBITDA by 4Q18. The R&amp;D phase is over, so all incremental revenue will fall to the bottom line, as 100% of costs are fixed. They are almost at break-even, so the cash is not a concern. The bigger issue is its still unclear where the explosive revs growth will come from. Their flagship product FOREWARN, an identity verification software package used by realtors, has a CAGR of +464%, but is still only at an annual run-rate of 0.7M.

December 2017: Several insider buys at prices between 24 and 31, in amounts of 500K-4.5M.

PIPELINE:

Bardoxolone (CKD caused by alport syndrome): CARDINAL Phase 2. Management peak sales estimate 5-10B (1), though analysts are not so convinced. Rare disease affecting 12K in US and 40K globally. No approved treatments. '\n''\n'Announced positive mid-stage phase 2 data on 7/23/18 that showed that at 1-year, patients saw an increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (measure of kidney function) at week 48 of 10.4 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p&lt;0.0001) compared to an average annual decline of 4.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 prior to study entry. The treatment effect represents a recovery of about two years of average eGFR loss. The data suggest that bardoxolone may delay or prevent kidney failure. On the safety front, no treatment-related serious adverse events were reported and there were no discontinuations.'\n'
Announced an update on 4/11/18 AH that efficacy is maintained through week 36 (mean improvement from baseline in eGFR is 11.3 mL/min/1.73m^2, which is not significantly difference from the change observed at week 12). Also, 90% of patients (n=27) remain on study through week 36 and will be included in week 52 withdrawal analysis. AEs have been generally mild to moderate.

Good phase 2 results so far, with 73% of patients improving in CKD stage at week 12, with no tolerability issues.'\n''\n'Bardoxolone (ADPKD and IgA nephropathy): Phase 2 PHOENIX complete. '\n''\n'Final results from PHOENIX announced on 7/23/18 showed that the study met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant increase in eGFR [9.3 mL/min/1.73 m2 (p&lt;0.0001)], representing a recovery of ~two years of eGFR loss. On the safety front, no treatment-related serious adverse events were reported. There was one discontinuation due to treatment-related fatigue.'\n''\n'Preliminary results from 5/25/18 showed a treatment benefit. Treatment with bardoxolone in 31 ADPKD patients showed significantly improved kidney function as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The mean improvement almost doubled from week 4 to week 12 (6.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 - 12.0 mL/min/1.73 m2). An 18% improvement in mean eGFR was observed in 29 IgA nephropathy patients through week 8 (46.2 mL/min/1.73 m2 - 54.6 mL/min/1.73 m2). Complete results should be available next quarter.

Bardoxolone (CTD-PAH): Phase 3. Connective tissue disease (CTD) represents 30% of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients. CTD-PAH is a late and often fatal manifestation of many types of autoimmune diseases. These patients are generally less responsive to existing therapies than other forms of PAH. Data 2H18. 

Bardoxolone (pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD)): Phase 2 complete. An SA author is skeptical of the drug, as it is based on oleanic acid, which can be obtained from consuming olive oil or garlic for the same anti-inflammatory effect.

3/22/18: Top-line data shows clinically meaningful improvement in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). Control groups improved 38m from baseline (p&lt;.05), whereas placebo had a non-significant reduction of 13m. But Sildefanil, commonly prescribed for PH, improved 48m from baseline in an open-label study. Market is not impressed with results. 

Omaveloxolone (Fridreichs ataxia): Phase 2 MOXie trial. 6K in US and 22K globally. Patients with FA experience progressive loss of coordination, muscle weakness, fatigue, etc and can lead to early death. No approved therapies. Orphan drug. 

Some other trials ongoing.

SAGE already has a product on the market in ZULRESSO for PPD. Analyst peak sales estimates range from $100M to $400M, but early sales have been disappointing. The main hope lies with SAGE-217, which is being tested for PPD, MDD, and TRD.

This explanation seems reasonable, and the FDA likely agrees, as they agreed with further development of the candidate.

A Phase 3 clinical trial, MOUNTAIN, evaluating SAGE-217 in adults with MDD failed to achieve the primary endpoint. Specifically, SAGE-217 did not sufficiently separate from placebo as measured by a scale called HAM-D total score at day 15. However, statistically significant reductions were observed at days 3, 8, and 12 (p&lt;0.018 at each timepoint). A post-hoc analysis revealed that ~9% of patients in the treatment group had no measurable drug concentration implying non-compliance. Excluding these, the separation from placebo was statistically valid at day 15 (p&lt;0.048). Also, the patient pool contained more mildly depressed patients vs more severely depressed patients from previous trials. This might also have contributed to the failure. Management thinks there is enough evidence of efficacy here to justify meeting with the FDA to discuss how to proceed.<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; white-space: normal;""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>'\n'<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; white-space: normal;"">'\n'</p>'\n'<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; white-space: normal;"">PIPELINE:<o:p></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; white-space: normal;""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>'\n'<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; white-space: normal;"">'\n'</p>'\n'<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times; white-space: normal;"">ZULRESSO (brexanalone) (PPD) (IV injection): Marketed.

PIPELINE:

KEVEYIS (dichlorphenamide) (PPP): Marketed. US Orphan exclusivity expires August 2022. They are working on obtaining some sort of patent protection but as of 4Q19 they have none. Annual sales of about $27M will likely begin to shrink at that point as cheap generics may enter the market. Very little value can be assigned at this time. 

RECORLEV (levoketoconazole) (endogenous Cushings syndrome): Phase 3 LOGICS. Showed adequate efficacy of about 30% on 8/8/18 in phase 3 SONIC trial (3). This is lower than COLTs Korlyms 40%, but Korlym and other drugs in this space come with serious liver side effects. Recorlev was poised to diffrentiate itself on safety. Unfortunately, two competing drugs with a better efficacy and safety profile are set to enter the market soon. The first is Novartis ISTURISA, which was approved in early 2020. It has efficacy of almost 90% and a decent safety profille (4). The second is an improved version of Korlym called Relacorilant (phase 3), which has shown similar efficacy and a much improved safety profile. Assuming market share above 20% for Recorlev seems unreasonable given these two new products. 

VELDOREOTIDE (acromegaly and other conditions amenable to somatostatin receptor activation): Several phase 2 studies completed ex-US as far back as 2008, with data suggesting that veldoreotide has just as good efficacy and possibly a better safety profile than octreotide. Octreotide, which NVS recently sold to Recordati and goes by the brand name Sandostatin LAR, had 2014 global sales of $1.6B before patent protection expired (1). The commercial opportunity is clearly there, but SBBP believes that its not commercially feasible given the 3x daily injections which are required for a therapeutic effect. They are working on a long-acting weekly dose, but as of 4Q19 they are still in the preclinical phase (2, pg 17-18). No value can be assigned at this time.

Though SEL-212 showed a numerically higher response rate during months 3 and 6 combined, it failed to meet the primary endpoint of statistical superiority. Serum uric acid level of less 6mg/dL for at least 80% of the time stood at 59% in SEL-212 arm, compared to 46% in the pegloticase group. But at month 3, a statistically significant higher response rate for SEL-212 versus pegloticase was observed. This would seem to indicate that the efficacy wears off over time.

Lead (and only) candidate Vicineum has completed phase 3 VISTA bladder cancer trials, and has thus far shown ever-so-slightly better efficacy than current treatments Valstra and Keytruda, but not decisively better. The majority of the ICER Council (8 yes, 3 no) judged Vicineum to be superior to best supportive care, and their final report concludes that Vicineum reduces treatment costs by $101k by year five (11). This shows that Vicineum potentially has advanced the science surrounding difficult to treat bladder cancer, but it's not entirely conclusive. For what it's worth, Dr. Tran says the results are very good in this difficult to treat patient group (6). Canaccord Genuity estimates peak US sales of $1B (7), and management projects US peak sales of $650M and global peak sales of $2B (9).

SB-318 (MPS I): Phase 1/2. MPS I is a lysosomal storage disorder. Dr. Tran says that SGMOs gene-editing approach is more competitive than conventional enzyme replacement therapy due to the less frequent need for treatment that, in and of itself, leads to better compliance and improved disease outcome. It also replaces the need for a bone marrow transplant which has a long waiting time and other associated complications (2).

Total urinary GAGs declined by 51%, dermatan sulfate by 32%, and heparan sulfate by 61% in Cohort 2 at 16 weeks. For GAG levels to decrease, it would imply that plasma IDS enzymes had to have been produced, which would imply that the gene editing took place. But the assay used thus far was not able to detect an increased level of enzymes, so its not conclusive yet. They are working on a new assay to hopefully detect enzymes at these lower levels. The important takeaway is that management says the GAG levels are what patients care about, and so far the low and mid-dose cohorts show early signs of efficacy. The higher dose cohort has been cleared for commencement. So far no safety issues (1).

The stock has gone up recently on a much-improved cash burn and strong preliminary 4Q20 results (2/4/21 AH), for which they estimate the highest ever Breast Products segment net sales of $17.9 million, representing 40% year over year growth. There is some commentary (discussed both in this plastic surgeons blog (1) and this other patient-focused blog (2)) suggesting that Sientras breast implants are better than Allergans and Mentors (i.e. more sizes and shapes available, a more cohesive gel which gives it a ""gummy bear"" feature that keeps the gel intact in case it ruptures, the best warranty available, and slightly lower rates of complications and cancers). But cancer rates and serious complications are so infinitesimally small with regards to breast augmentation that Im not sure this will be enough to take serious market share from the other two. At the moment, SIEN has about 10% share. Could be a Top Idea if we had a bit more info to definitively conclude that Sientras is far and away the best product, but even the blogs mentioned above say that you can get pretty similar results with any of the brands. q5/pass

They received FDA approval in 2012 and broke the decades-long duopoly held by JNJ and Allergan. The stock crashed in September 2015 when German regulators found traces of silicone and cotton during an inspection that temporarily halted sales in the EU and caused the company to proactively suspend sales of newly manufactured breast implants in the US. The stock eventually recovered to $25/share as the supply chain was diversified away from the Brazilian contract manufacturer that failed the quality control inspection. But since then, the market has realized that even with a return to sales, the growth is not strong enough to ensure a clear path to break-even. Sales in 2019 were $84M, which is almost double the $45M in 2014. But during that time, SGA also went from $34M to $123M. Management says they will be break-even by late 2021, but even so, its not clear this is undervalued. Pass.

PIPELINE:

SGT-001 (DMD in ambulatory/non-ambulatory children): Phase 1/2 IGNITE DMD started November 2017. 

3/14/18: -50% on news of clinical hold after first patient dosed had to be hospitalized a few days after administration on 2/14/18. Laboratory findings showed a decrease in platelet count followed by a reduction in red blood cell count and evidence of complement activation. However, the patient showed no signs of coagulopathy (bleeding disorder) or relevant changes from baseline in liver function tests. The patient lab parameters have either improved or returned to normal and is currently asymptomatic. An SA author concludes that they are medically fine and that this is a good buying opportunity.

It may be time to jump in after recent 50% drop. SA article today confirms that the FDA hold on the DMD trial is likely temporary. the first child to be dosed was hospitalized because of low platelet count followed by a red blood cell reduction, but did not experience any bleeding. this would have been a very bad sign, and indicates that they are fine from a medical perspective. also, very recently there have been some large insider buys.

But for the acne trials, one trial showed SLGL far above the competition, but the other trial showed them no better than everyone else. Without a clear separation from competitors, its difficult to assign a probability of success, as every company thinks their own acne treatment will do $100M+ in sales.

Additionally, the cost of fidaxomicin is more than double that of vancomycin at $3,360, compared with $1,273 vancomycin capsules and $21.90 for generic metronidazole. Vancomycin on the other hand often requires IV infusion (although there are pills available for treatment as well) which can increases costs and can cause a slew of adverse reactions which limit its use, often to more severe cases.

Announced that it is working with a new joint venture formed by the four largest mobile operators in the United States  AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon  to help deliver an advanced mobile messaging experience across all four mobile networks. Based on the Rich Communications Services (RCS) standard, developed with technology partner WIT Software, this platform has the potential to create a messaging ecosystem that allows consumer brands to create a new level of engagement and meet growing preferences for content rich, personalized interactions via messaging communications. As usual, no financials were discussed, and this still seems like ICLD to me. Move from q4 to pass. cp 37k. tp 26k.'\n''\n'11/4/19 AH: -20%. 3Q19. Cash 20M, burn 12M. Adj revs growth +1% (this excludes the 26M write-down of accounts receivables that they deem uncollectible as partner STI explores strategic alternatives . . . given the previous filing restatements and now this write-down, I dont think we can trust management at all). Announced a new cloud deal with a major Tier-1 carrier, but as usual no financials were disclosed. They say they expect to return to double-digit revs growth in 2020 but even if we believe them (which I dont) it still does not get them to profitability if its only 10% growth. Needs to be much higher for break-even. Its not certain that this is a complete scam but more dilution seems very certain. Pass. q4. cp 37k. tp 26k.'\n''\n'8/5/19 BO: -2%. 2Q19. Cash 79M, burn 11M. Annual guidance is reaffirmed. They are paying down debt and have enough cash to pay off the remaining 47M due this month. But the revs guidance is for only 7% growth (supported by the partnerships already announced and the partnerships they expect to announce 2H19), so this is not really impressive for a high-growth tech company. After over a year following this company its still not entirely clear what they do, so finding a reason to think the revs growth rate will explode is difficult. Using adj EBITDA guidance, if we assume that for 2020 D&amp;A will be 0, the forward PE is 7. But assuming 0 for D&amp;A means that capex going forward will be 0 (they are spending 23M this year on growth capex). It does not seem discounted enough given the risks. More dilution seems likely. I would lighten to the target. q4. cp 42k. tp 30k.'\n''\n'5/10/19: +15%. 1Q19. Cash 101M, burn 15M. Revs growth is still low at 5% yoy.

They expected to end 2018 with 175M in cash but instead only have 138M. Revs declined 23% for 3 reasons: 1) revs restatement from prior years pushed some revs into 2017, 2) transition to Verizon Cloud from a freemium to premium model, and 3) transition away from datacenter hosting model. Revs guidance for 2019 is for only 7% growth. They are winning lots of new customers and signing lots of deals, but there are not specifics attached to any of the new customer wins. Very vague still. They did realize 20M in annual cost savings in 2018 and will see another 25M in savings realized in 2019, but this will be offset by 20-25M in increased RD/SGA spending to grow the business. With 138M cash on hand, they have enough to retire the convertible notes of 114M in August 2019. And they also have the option to pay the 7M per quarter of preferred dividends in cash or in stock. But with 2019 adj EBITDA guidance of only 35M, capex of at least 26M (2018 figure), and at least 26M of stock compensation (2018 figure), its not really clear that this is a good buy and that there wont be dilution by year end. Move from q2 to q5. cp 39k. tp 68k. q5 tp 36k.   '\n''\n'11/7/18: Flat. 3Q18 was nothing spectacular. They finally returned to a positive revs growth rate (which was expected), and they are on track to realize 25M in savings for 2019. But even with an extra 6M saved per quarter, they need much higher revs growth to get to break-even. Expect to end 2018 with 170-180M.'\n''\n'9/27/18 AH: +15%. NASDAQ suspension will be lifted on Monday.'\n''\n'8/9/18: +21%. 2Q18 was in-line, and they are anticipating a return to positive sequential revs growth during 2H18. Margins will increase from these levels through efficiency gains and cost cutting in the cloud segment (up to 20M). The drop of 80M in cash included 50M in one-time expenses. Actual cash burn is about 20M. '\n''\n'7/30/18: -25%. Stifel cuts PT from 8 to 3. 

7/2/18: +15%. They finally release restated filings and 1Q18 results. As management had said, cash on hand is about 320M. The restatements were due to accounting discrepancies such as recognizing all subscription revenue upfront vs gradually, etc. No customers were lost during the refiling period. However, guidance will not be discussed until the 2Q18 call.

3/28/18: Provided a very general business update about the cloud services they offer. The only material information given is that the cash balance is at 249M right now (not including anything from Siris), 100% of customers have been retained throughout the recent ""transition"" period, and the restated filings will be done by May 10.

SNDX has had a string of disappointing results starting in May, then again in September, and then again in October. But there are some silver linings.

However, for a specific subpopulation with a certain biomarker, the ORR was 29%, and SNDX plans on continuing to a phase 3 targeting this specific group of patients. For the October breast cancer readout, PFS statistical significance was not met, and this would have provided the quickest path to regulatory approval. However, the trial will continue for OS (with an analysis every 6 months), and management has said that positive results in OS will be enough for full approval. q4

PIPELINE:

Entinostat + keytruda (NSCLC): Phase 2 ENCORE 601. Phase 3 should commence by end-2018. Thus far has shown manageable toxicity profile. Of the 84K patients who have NSCLC and receive 2nd and 3rd line therapies (chemo + PD-1/L1), 33% (30K) would be eligible for this combo therapy (investor presentation 5/17/18). On 9/24/18 AH they released updated phase 2 data showing 10% ORR (n=7/72) compared to 11% reported in May 2018. The market was disappointed with results reported on 5/17/18. ORR was only 11% (n=6/57) in NSCLC patients who had received prior treatment with a PD-1/L1 inhibitor + chemo. Median duration of response was 4.6 months. However, for a subpopulation with high levels of peripheral blood monocytes (n=14), ORR was 29% (n=4/14) and PFS was 5.4 months, which compares favorably to the 2.8 month benefit recently demonstrated. In contrast, the subpopulation of patients characterized by low levels of monocytes (n=37) only demonstrated ORR of 5% (n=2/37) and PFS of 2.5 months. It is hypothesized that monocyte levels may reflect the ability of the immune system to respond after elimination of immune suppression.

Entinostat + keytruda (melanoma): Phase 2 ENCORE 601 complete. They are looking for biomarkers before deciding whether to continue to phase 3. On 4/1/19 they reported phase 1/2b ORR of 19%.

Entinostat + keytruda (colorectoral cancer (CRC)): Discontinued after phase 2 ENCORE 601.

Entinostat + tecentriq (TNBC): Phase 2 ENCORE 602.

Entinostat + bavencio (ovarian cancer): Phase 2 ENCORE 603.

Entinostat + aromasin (HER2-breast cancer): Phase 3 E2112. On 10/26/18 they announced that the first primary endpoint of PFS was not met with statistical significance. This would have been the fastest path for approval. As planned, ECOG-ACRIN is confidentially holding the findings from the PFS analysis until reporting final OS results. After recently performing the third interim OS analysis, ECOG-ACRIN informed the Company that the trial will continue as planned until either it observes an OS benefit or the final target number of events occur. The next interim analysis for the OS primary endpoint is scheduled for 2Q19 with additional interim analyses every six months. Based on the trial design, any positive OS assessment would enable the Company to file for full regulatory approval. Management says that it was Phase 2b OS results that led to the FDA granting Breakthrough Therapy Designation for this indication and we remain confident in the opportunity for a positive OS trial.'\n''\n'SNDX-6352 (solid tumors): Phase 1.",,3,6,23.87,18.05,0,0,0,0.55

PIPELINE:

ROLONTIS (eflapegrastim) (CIN for breast cancer): Phase 3 ADVANCE complete. SPA. Head to head comparison vs AMGNs neulasta. Results from the ADVANCE study were announced on 2/5/18. They met the primary efficacy endpoint of non-inferiority in Duration of Severe Neutropenia between ROLONTIS and neulasta (p&lt;0.0001). ROLONTIS showed an absolute risk reduction of severe neutropenia of 8.5 percent compared to pegfilgrastim (84.2% vs 75.7%) in Cycle 1. The adverse event profile was similar between the two treatment arms. Follow-up data was released on 5/17/18. Shows non-inferiority to AMGNs neulasta across all 4 treatment cycles, and no statistically significant differences across all secondary endpoints. Safety profiles remain similar.

Rolontis (eflapegrastim) (CIN for breast cancer): Phase 3 RECOVER complete. Announced that it also met the primary efficacy endpoint of non-inferiority in DSN between ROLONTIS and pegfilgrastim. The adverse event profile was also similar between the two treatment arms. Positive phase 2a results announced September 2014.

Qapzola (apaziquone) (NMIBC): Phase 2 results very good. Received new SPA from FDA for phase 3, which will include fewer patients, a higher dosage, and time-to-recurrence as primary endpoint. Began enrolling in 3Q2017.

Two previous phase 3 trials that were single dose did not meet statistical significance on primary endpoint of rate of tumor recurrence at 2 years.

POZIOTINIB (NSCLC with exon20 mutation): Phase 2 ZENITH20 (SPPI-sponsored) and also phase 2 (MD Andersen center-sponsored). The excitement surrounding this drug is due to the fact that it could be effective in treating both EGFR and HER2 exon 20 mutations across a wide array of solid tumors, as they occur in at least 26 different cancer types. Based on preclinical data, they are also expanding investigations into the treatment of osimertinib failures and atypical mutations.'\n''\n'Average NSCLC ORR for EFGR TKIs is 3% (w/o 763insFQEA) or 8% (w/ 763insFQEA). Average ORR for HER2 TKIs is 12%. For patients that dont respond to 1st line therapies, they are only left with non-targeted standard 2nd line therapies such as docetaxel (ORR 9-13%), or PD/PD-L1 inhibitors (ORR 4-19%) (2). Thats why the 43% ORR thus far for phase 2 is very encouraging (primary objective ORR &gt;= 20%). Lead physician called the early efficacy results remarkable.

VALUATION: consensus 15.00 (1). Eric 5.33 (4.46 + 0.87 expected value of cash reward)

SUMMARY: 

EVENTS:'\n'
4/30/18: +77%. UTHR will acquire STDY for 4.46/share plus an additional 2.63/share (7.09/share total) upon certain commercialization milestones for Treyvent (milestones not disclosed). Total deal valued at 216M (including 75M contingent consideration). 

12/8/17: FDA decides additional trials will not be required for Treyvent NDA resubmission. Shares up 15%. 

11/14/17: Favorable appeals court ruling upholds previous ruling and invalidates all 22 patent claims from UTHR for active ingredient trepostinil in 393 patent. 

PIPELINE:

Treyvent (pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)): Treyvent (combined with implantable PatchPump technology) is a sterile, pre-filled, pre-programmed, waterproof, single use disposable infusion system for patented delivery of trepostinil (the active ingredient in Treyvent and Remodulin). UTHR''s Remodulin sold 600M in 2016, and management thinks the addressable market is 4B, as only 3,000 out of 30,000 in US who have pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) take Remodulin. 

RTF letter from FDA requested additional info on pump specs and performance testing as well as design verification and validation testing. Value proposition of STDY is that UTHR''s Remodulin requires patient/provider to mix each dose, pain at site of injection from preservatives, not waterproof. This is a good opportunity to profit from an FDA setback that is not safety-related or requires an additional trial. The risk is that MDT''s SynchroMedII pump is cleared for use with Remodulin. 

It has been approved for other treatments, but in April 2015 FDA issued a consent decree requiring MDT to immediately stop manufacturing, designing, and distributing pump citing quality system violations. On 3/14/17, a class I recall was announced. On 4/3/17, UTHR says US launch of MDT pump and Remodulin will be delayed until 2018. MDT says a software update will fix issue.",,3,6,4.73,4.72,0,0,0,0.00

Neurostar is a dentist-like chair that administers electric stimulation to the brains of patients in order to treat depression. There are several other types of these chairs on the market, but none have as much extensive research as STIMs. Some evidence shows 12-month remission rates of 45%, however in some studies it failed to achieve the primary endpoint. As of 2019, there were only 1,100 units installed, and 2020 revs guidance is for $70M, representing only 12% growth. Given that the device has been FDA-approved since 2008, it seems reasonable to conclude that the lackluster sales thus far indicate that it just doesnt work that well. Approved depression drugs also dont work that well, but at least they are much cheaper to try. I am skeptical that even if Neurostar is approved for other indications that it will have a meaningful impact on sales. Pass.

SUMMARY: Retail segment is losing money consistently. Retail stores are Farm Fresh in Virginia, Hornbachers in Midwest, etc. Management is focusing on wholesale segment, which is doing well and growing organically. Walmart is closing small-store locations in very rural areas, having decided that it cannot make money in those low-population density areas. SVU aims to fill that void, showing that along with operating in dense urban and suburban areas, it can also be profitable in rural American as well. The recent acquisitions give it a nationwide distribution system. The wholesale segment is also focusing on ethnic food offerings (i.e. Latin items), gourmet offerings (i.e. Seattle area), and natural/organic items (i.e. San Francisco area).

Recently acquired Unified Grocers for 390M, allowing it to expand to the West Coast and serve the predominantly Hispanic Southern California market, along with the gourmet Oregon/Washington markets. Cost synergies of 60M by year 3. 

Also, recently acquired Associated Grocers for 180M, allowing it to expand in South Florida, the Caribbean, and Latin America. Will see 16M in cost synergies in 2 years. Associated Grocers has annual sales of 690M.

1) Monetize through sale or leaseback part of 17.3M square feet of company-owned real estate, which is worth more than current market cap of 759M alone. 
2) Divest up to 30% of 217 retail stores, and use remaining retail stores to roll out new services such as delivery and meal preparation services.

Note: FDA does not distinguish between military and civilian PTSD. Global PTSD market expected to be 10.7B by 2026. 

Tonmya is a sublingual (under the tongue) form of cyclobenzaprine, which was previously branded in pill form as Flexeril. Therapy is generally considered the primary treatment. Currently only two approved medications for PTSD, Zoloft (sertraline) and Paxil (paroxetine). Both show limited efficacy, leading to the widespread of use of off-lable drugs that have serious side effects such as sexual dysfunction, insomnia, and withdrawal. None of these unapproved, off label use drugs have been shown to be effective in treating military-related PTSD and some of them are deemed unsafe according the VA/DoD's Clinical Practice Guideline.

Tonmya was evaluated in a Phase 2b study called the AtEase Study. The results of this study were disappointing, but trended towards positive. The study did not meet its primary endpoint for either the 2.8 or the 5.6 mg dose. It also did not meet statistical significance for several other measures with the 2.8mg dose. On the bright side, there was a clear positive dose response and some secondary measures were met for the 5.6mg dose. Tonix was also able to demonstrate in post-study analysis that patients who had more severe symptoms at the start of the study showed a better response. Perhaps the most encouraging data was related to remission rates. There was statistically significant improvement in the percentage of patients that were in clinical remission (no symptoms) at both 8 and 12 weeks (5.2% placebo vs 14.3%, 2.8mg vs 21.1%, 5.6 mg). Most side effects were not a major issue, but tongue/oral numbness issues were common.

The Phase 3 Study has a better chance for positive topline results due to the requirement that the baseline CAPS-5 score must be at least 33 (more severe symptoms) to qualify for the study (see slide 38 of July 2018 presentation). CAPS-5 &gt;=29 was the minimum in phase 2. In addition, the 5.6mg dose is the only dose being used in the study. This should result in better efficacy results than the Phase 2 Study. However, it is basically certain that tongue/oral issues will again be noted and this may impact dropout rates and questions about adequate blinding.'\n''\n'TONMYA (TNX-102 SL) (agitation in Alzheimers disease): Phase 2.

TRIL is one of the few public companies investigating the checkpoint inhibitor CD47, a molecule that tumors frequently use to evade the immune system. Targeting CD47 is an approach that is looking more and more promising in the oncology field, and TRIL believes that its treatments offer some advantages over competitors (namely that it can be used as a monotherapy and doesnt bind red blood cells).

Because TiO2 is widely used in paint and other coatings, titanium feedstocks are in higher demand prior to the painting season in the Northern Hemisphere (spring and summer), and pig iron is in lower demand during the European summer holidays, when many steel plants and foundries undergo maintenance. Zircon generally is a non-seasonal product; however, it is negatively impacted by the winter and Chinese New Year celebrations due to reduced zircon demand from China. We may be adversely affected by existing or future cyclical changes, and such conditions may be sustained or further aggravated by anticipated or unanticipated changes in regional weather conditions. For example, poor weather conditions in a region can lead to an abbreviated painting season, which can depress consumer sales of paint products that use TiO2.

Summary: SA PT $1/share.

Dropped from a high of 22.50 in 2015 shortly after IPO to about 5.00. Initial company ethos was squarely on the side of consumers, painting the dealers as crooks and the bad guy. TV ad blitzes highlighted TRUE customers that saved thousands of dollars buying a car using TRUE and sticking it to the dealer. Car dealerships dropped TRUE en masse, with some state auto groups going so far as to cut advertising funding to dealerships that didnt drop TRUE. 

Realizing they were angering their true customers, TRUE softened their tone a lot, and focused less on getting a great price for car customers and instead keeping dealerships happy. Plenty of reports illustrate how a customer can now find the same car up to 3K dollars cheaper by shopping outside of the TRUE car dealership network. Its still a convenient service, but no longer gets car customers the lowest possible price. About 50% of all new car buyers start out on TRUE website, but conversion rate is only 5%.

After a few quarters of earnings beats and growth of monthly unique visitors of 20% YOY, stock climbed back up to 22 starting in early 2016. Gross margins have consistently been around 90%, so managements hope is that the increase in SGA will lead to high growth in unique monthly visitors which will lead to profitability.

But with increasing competition from autotrader, cargurus, Edmunds, etc. its tough to see where the growth in unique visitors will come from to get to managements goal of doubling audience by 2019.

Also, Amazon has been experimenting with online car sales in Italy, and now throughout Europe. An announcement that it will offer cars online in the US is inevitable and will surely sink TRUE stock price.

Does have partnerships with USAA, AAA, Chase, Sams Club, etc. that all educate consumers on how to purchase a car. But other online sites also have these partnerships.

While they did say that the production of the Chinese gigafactory has turned out to be much more efficient than the US plants, such a large reduction in capex spending seems unusual given the coming ramp-ups in China and the EU (its worth noting that not one analyst asked about 4Q19 capex on the call). Lastly, while automotive gross margins improved to 23% sequentially, they are still down from the 26% last year, and well below the 30% long-term target.

Political spending is typically highest during the fourth quarter. In addition to advertising revenue seasonality, our Entertainment net revenue exhibits seasonality resulting in the third quarter being the highest revenue period, followed by the second, then fourth, then first quarter. Large drivers of this seasonality are our multi-day music festivals and NAMEs revenue which is concentrated in the third quarter.

Buprenorphine treatment is the gold standard of opioids, selling over $2B in the US in 2016. TTNPs probuphine implantable device addresses the challenges of outpatient daily dosing. A physician wrote a good article about the nightmarish approval process doctors currently have to go through for getting insurance companies to approve first the implant, then the procedure.

Parkinsons is characterized by the loss of dopamine, which alters activity in the brain region impacting motor functions. The current standard of treatment are pulsatile drugs, but after several years, they can lose the benefit and trigger serious side effects.

The infrastructure segment seems like it will be busy for a bit, and they emphasized that in Puerto Rico this is just a temporary pause. Here is IRs response by my questions:'\n'1. Of the 17B in work that PREPA projects it will cost to upgrade the Puerto Rico grid, 12-13B of it applies to TUSK, and they would be happy with getting 20-30% of that. Again, this bidding should start 2H19 and work should commence 1H20, but Congress needs to allocate the funds.
2. The future work in Puerto Rico will be for reconstruction/upgrades vs the restoration work that has been done up until now. They cannot give guidance on what the reconstruction/upgrades margins will be, but its generally higher than comparable work in the US.
3. They have not seen any resistance to winning US contracts due to being thought of as storm chasers. At the end of 3Q17, the US backlog was 30M and now its at 625M. At any given time they are bidding on 2-3B of US grid work. 

5/2/18: -8%. 1Q18 saw EPS miss. The quarter was challenging due to harsh working environments, severe winter weather, and logistical issues. Reduced debt to 39M from 110M and should be fully paid off soon. Within 30 days there should be news about whether they won an RFP bidding process for long-term grid upgrades. The margins will be lower but it will be welcome news. The backlog grew to 500M for continental US infrastructure work. It also will be for lower margins compared to PR, but still good news. 
Management did discuss some tax complications arising from being in Puerto Rico, where the tax rate is 45%. They are looking into creating an LLC elsewhere to limit the tax exposure.

REASONS FOR LONG-TERM PESSIMISM:
Long term, I am still not a believer. In fact, I believe this is a rally in the context of a bear condition on this stock. I think the business model is very problematic, and it may take years to work out. There will be a painful realization that the ride-share business is a commodity.

REASONS FOR SHORT-TERM OPTIMISM (ALL VERY FLUFFY IMHO):

Chatter, a lot of analysts are expecting a turn, and some have announced that it's their best trade for 2020 (see below)

Travis Kalanick sold out his whole position $2+ billion all at once and resigned from the board so that selling pressure is over.

The IPO expiration selling has played itself out writ large.

Dara Kosrowshahi has committed to profitability by 2020. I expect some announcements selling big foreign divisions, or even Uber-Eats, and doubling down elsewhere, in the next few weeks.

Barring that, I expect an analyst meeting during which he announces progress on his plan for profitability.

PIPELINE:

SCI-B-VAC (hepatitis B): Marketed in Israel and 9 other countries but small sales so far. Regulatory submissions in US, EU, and Canada expected 4Q20. There is a chance it could become the standard of care for Hepatitis B but its not entirely clear that it will displace GSK or DVAX vaccines.

GSKs Energix-B sells almost $1B each year (1) so the global market is large. One of the problems with Energix-B is that it requires 3 doses spaced months apart and the final dose is often skipped. VBIV was hoping to be able to submit the NDA asking for a 2-dose label, but the trial results will only support a 3-dose label at this point. The trial was run to show non-inferiority against Energix-B but ended up showing clinical superiority (15% difference) for ages 18+. But its not clear whether this is enough to completely displace Energix-B since GSKs marketing budget will dwarf whatever salesforce VBIV builds out, and another competitor (DVAX) might have better results. 

DVAX finally received approval (after several CRLs) for its HEPLISAV-B vaccine, which is on track for $44M in sales for 2020. The FDA had had safety concerns regarding it potentially causing autoimmune conditions as well as cardiac events and ended up only granting approval for ages 18+. However, interim results of a post-marketing study have so far shown no safety issues (3). The competitive edge is that it gets very high efficacy (also above 90% like VBIV) and only requires two doses (spaced one month apart), so compliance rates will likely be higher. DVAX management expects US peak sales of $500M (2).

MACI revenue is stronger in the second quarter and fourth quarter due to a number of factors including insurance copay limits and the time of year patients prefer to start rehabilitation. Epicel revenue is also subject to seasonal fluctuations mostly associated with the use of heating elements during the colder months, with stronger sales occurring in the winter months of the first and fourth quarters, and weaker sales occurring in the hot summer months of the third quarter. However, in any single year, this trend can be absent due to the extreme variability inherent with Epicels patient volume.

MACI (patient-grown knee cartilage replacement surgery for ages 18-55): Commercialized 2017.

First FDA-approved (Dec 2016) tissue engineered autologous cellularized scaffold product. Clinical results showed statistically significant improvement in pain, function, and response rate scores of MACI vs microfracture procedure. Currently only has 10% penetration in MACI population (about 1K patients), but should see continued strong growth due to health care providers updating policies to allow for coverage, increased number of trained surgeons (500+), and expanded salesforce. 

Is also initiating a MACI trial in pediatric patients, so along with expanded salesforce, will see expenses increase by 2M/quarter.

Epicel (total body surface area (TBSA) burns &gt; 40%): Marketed. $120M addressable market US (assumes 600 surviving patients with &gt;40% burn area x 1.25 (25% re-order rate) x 67 grafts/order x $2,354/graft . . . from Jan 2018 company presentation).

The only FDA-approved autologous epidermal product available for large total body burns. Has been approved as a Humanitarian Device in US, but may now be sold for profit on up to 360K grafts per year. Statistically significant increased probability of survival using Epicel has been verified in studies. Now available in 40 burn centers, up from 20 in 2014.

It is clipped on to the shirt collar and acts as a hands-free device for hospital workers to communicate with each other (i.e. receive alerts from EMT about emergency patients on the way, call for a specialist, access health care apps in one location, etc.). As of March 2020 they had 20% penetration in US hospitals, with 2020 revs guidance of $191M indicating 6% growth. There is room to grow, but only 6% revs growth seems low for a new product that has been on the market for several years now. An SA article from 2014 pointed out that if they were acquired by a larger company with an existing salesforce that already sells to hospitals, their S&amp;M expenses ($63M) and G&amp;A expenses ($25M) could be largely eliminated and profitability would improve dramatically. But no buyout offers thus far. Without assuming a huge increase in the penetration rate, making the case that this is undervalued will be difficult. q4.

The only explanation for why the stock has been on a steady decline since hitting a high of 8 in May 2018 is the expectation that the high price of TiO2 will have to eventually come down (1). Also, investors dont seem to like that an increasing TiO2 price is making up for a decrease in TiO2 volume. The TiO2 market is set to double by 2024, as it is being used in an increasing number of applications like solar panels, but investors might be worried that the continued rise in TiO2 pricing could attract government intervention, given how few producers there are left. What little information we can get so far from Bloomberg also indicates that analysts expect a decline in pricing through 2H18, so the estimated 2018 net income for 300M will likely be much lower for 2019.

The effects of these variances make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the results of any specific quarter.'\n''\n'SUMMARY: While the media landscape remains challenging, Viacom is still a very profitable company with a stable of popular channels such as Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, BET, and MTV. Also has released popular movies such as Transformers. The re-emphasis on producing quality content seems to be working, as ratings are going up and the poor financial trends have stabilized, with an uptick in revenues already visible. Subscribers to cable does continue to decline, and does have a large debt load, but interest payments are not a problem right now. But has rolled out a lower-priced cable bundle that doesnt include sports which should help keep some viewers who watch the shows but not the games.

EVENTS:'\n''\n''\n'2/5/19: +1%. 1Q18. no negative surprises. The Bumblebee Transformers movie did very well for the Paramount movie segment, and they continue to do well in the TV segment.

As expected, the core business has returned to growth. Recent movies such as Mission Impossible and A Quiet Place have also done very well. Total debt has been reduced by 1B.'\n''\n'8/9/18: +6%. 3QFY18 saw continued revs declines of -3%, but reduced SGA expenses led to a beat on EPS. They are seeing less revs from advertising, but strong growth in films, affiliates, and live events are offsetting this. 

4/25/18: +3%. 2Q18 was solid all-around. Modest declines in domestic Media Networks revs was offset by double-digit growth in all international segments. All channels (Nickelodeon, BET, VHI, MTV) continue to grow market share and ratings. The Jersey Shore reboot reached 10M viewers opening weekend. Legacy films continued to weigh on revenue, but Paramount Pictures of Filmed Entertainment segment returned to profitability with the new managements first release A Quiet Place, which cost 20M to produce and has grossed over 200M globally so far. Upcoming releases like Mission Impossible should continue to do well. The turnaround is underway.

2/7/18: 1Q18 revs 3B, -8% YOY. Net income 535M. EPS 1.03. Even though revenue declined operating income went up. TV and digital segments are growing ratings, but movie segment declined. Is on track to achieve 100M in savings in 2018, and hundreds of millions more in 2019. Retired 1B worth of notes. US ad revenue has stabilized. Good quarter.

11/16/17: 4Q17 earnings saw revs of 3.2B, +2.8% YOY driven by growth in worldwide advertising. Revs up 6% for the year. Net income 674M. Is seeing positive improvement in revs, adjusted operating income, adjusted EPS, and operating cash flow.

Viacom still has the #1 share of viewing on cable, with #1 share for several diverse and coveted audiences such as kids 2-11, millennials, African-Americans, etc. In the quarter, Media Networks segment grew ratings 3% YOY, with flagship networks up 6% and double-digit increases at MTV and BET. (Very significant, as MTV achieved first double-digit ratings increase in more than six years, driven by primetime viewership of new #1 show Siesta Key. Also, Comedy Central, driven by #1 late night talk show The Daily Show With Trevor Noah, grew ratings in its key demo for first time since 2014. 

Paramount TV continued significant growth, more than tripling revenues with breakout shows Shooter, 13 Reasons Why, and Berlin Station. Notable film releases for early 2018 include Daddys Home 2 and Downsizing.",,3,6,24.27,28.07,0,0,0,0.00

Have failed to advance in the clinic until MDGLs candidate demonstrated selective ability to lower cholesterol without increasing thyroid hormone levels elsewhere (by targeting beta and not alpha receptors). If VKTX2809 can demonstrate this same selectivity then the share price will appreciate significantly.

FANAPT (schizophrenia): Marketed in US and EU. Approved in 2009. Initiated US sales campaign in April 2015, completed sales expansion in 1Q 2017. SA author estimates global peak sales of 150-200M (3) for current indication (and much more for injectable version and other indications) but for 2018 guidance is for 72-82M and growth is flattish.'\n''\n'Management has not been able to provide a clear reason as to why sales are not stronger. Was asked during the call about what they are seeing in the territory data that makes them optimistic, and the answers were vague.  . . . an examination of US territories leads us to believe an expanded US sales team can return Fanaptum to growth, but then said, were not very confident growth can happen. Also said, As we put more resources in, we see territory growth go up. 90% of territories are seeing growth, and remaining 10% are what is causing overall growth rate to be negative sequentially, but did say whether the 10% reflect populated urban markets or not. 

HETLIOZ (non-24 sleep disorder, adults): FDA approval January 2014. EU approval July 2015. Costs about 15K for 30 capsules (20mg/day). Prevalence in the US is 100K people (2). Assume 150K in EU. SA author says peak sales are 300-500M (3).

HETLIOZ (non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, pediatrics): Phase 3.

HETLIOZ (jet lag): Phase 2 complete. Each year, 30M US residents make trips abroad. Management says the cost will be the same as for non-24, but the treatment will last 3 days instead of 1 (so assume 5K/month). While Hetlioz is on patent, the revs contribution will not be significant for jet lag, but could become so once patent has expired. One SA author estimates peak sales at 50-100M (3) while on patent. After that, the price could drop to $100/passenger/year, and they could see peak sales of 1B+.  '\n''\n'Phase 2 results on 5/23/18 showed that hetlioz was effective in treating Jet Lag Disorder in travelers who flew from the US to the UK (1). Tasimelteon significantly improved total sleep time of the first 2/3 of the night (TST 2/3) on night 3, in both objective and subjective measures of sleep. Tasimelteon-treated patients slept 76 minutes longer during their second trip as compared to their first. Cumulatively over the 3 travel nights of their second trip, tasimelteon-treated patients added 131 minutes of sleep (TST 2/3) as compared to the 3 travel nights of the first trip. Due to the complexity of the study, the study was terminated before it reached the original enrollment goal of 90 patients, with only 25 patients completing both phases of the study (tasimelteon n=13, placebo n=12).'\n''\n'HETLIOZ (Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS)): Phase 3. SMS is a very rare disease that causes physical and behavioral defects. Likely Orphan disease. The prevalence of SMS in the U.S. is between 12,000 and 20,000 patients while the number of patients in the EU is close to 40,000. SA author peak sales estimate 150-250M (3). '\n'
VTR-297 (relapsed and/or refractory hematologic malignancies): Phase 1 will begin by end 2018.

TRADIPITANT (chronic pruritus in AD): Phase 3 EPIONE complete. Chronic pruritus affects 1M people globally and treatments are ineffective. Reported phase 3 EPIONE results on 2/25/20. The EPIONE study did not meet its primary endpoint in reduction of pruritus across the overall study population. However, the antipruritic effect of tradipitant was robust in the mild AD study population. Mild AD represents over 60% of the total AD population in the U.S.1, 2 The EPIONE study continued to demonstrate that tradipitant is safe and well-tolerated. Eric not impressed.'\n''\n''\n'TRADIPITANT (gastroparesis): Phase 2. US prevalence 6M, with 600K diagnosed every year (3). Evoke Pharma estimates the gastroparesis market at $3-4 billion a year, but Evokes candidate failed in phase 3 trials in gastroparesis earlier this year. 10-20% market share of such a large market translates to $300-800 million in annual sales for tradipitant.
'\n'The company is encouraged by recent data highlighting aprepitants (Emend) efficacy in gastroparesis. Aprepitant is also an NK1 receptor agonist like tradipitant and, although it failed to meet the primary endpoint in the gastroparesis trial conducted by NIH, it showed statistically significant reductions in mean 4-week daily hours of nausea (p=0.03) and mean 4-week GCSI scores (p=0.001). The aprepitant patient group also experienced greater symptom improvements based on multiple PAGI-SYM and GSRS measures, including overall symptom relief, nausea, vomiting, postprandial fullness, bloating and abdominal pain. These results increase tradipitants chances of success and management is particularly pleased with the fact that aprepitant showed potential to actually modify the disease and not just manage the symptoms.'\n''\n'TRADIPITANT (motion sickness): Phase 2 initiated January 2019.'\n''\n'GLOSSARY:'\n'AD: atopic dermatitis'\n''\n'SOURCES:'\n''\n'1. http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=196233&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2350433'\n'2. http://www.rxeconsult.com/healthcare-articles/Hetlioz-tasimelteon-Cost-Dosing-Side-effects-Uses-534/'\n'3. https://seekingalpha.com/article/4026642-vanda-valued-like-plain-pharma-company-one",,3,6,13.37,13.36,0,0,0,0.00

Howevever, the continuing frustration over the low stock price came through and loud and clear on the call, and management was accused of putting lipstick on a pig with their modest reforms. Analysts pointed out (correctly) that they still have 1.5M share remaining to repurchase from the last authorization but have not purhcased a material amount since 2015. The chairman owns over 50% of the voting power so common shareholders are unable to implement meaningful changes.

But the consumer accessories segment continues to decline. They are consolidating two companies in Germany into one, and have also retained an advisor to explore divestiture possibilities of this segment. Margins continue to improve throgh cost-cutting, and they expect to be profitable 2HFY19 from continued auto segment growth. The most exciting news is that EyeLock will see 500K in revs this year from slot machine sales.

But a drop in revs was expected, as the revs are lumpy and affected by when OEM contracts with car manufacturers start and stop. There are new OEM programs with GM, Subaru, and Nissan starting 2HFY19. By the end of the year, EVO entertainment system should be in 14-15 different car models. The most advanced sub-woofer coming to Best Buy in August. Working on big projects with Margaritaville and Hard Rock Cafe to outfit their locations with media. Eyelock is launching this quarter in vending machines (they get royalties per device, very high gross profit). It will be a small contribution this year but talks with potential customers are moving to advanced stages and so should be a large contribution next year. About 10M is spent on Eyelock each year, so hitting break-even of 10M in sales could happen by late FY20. '\n''\n'5/15/18: -5%. 4Q18 missed on revs by 7M. Operations are still not profitable, but they have plenty of cash. It was still not the breakout quarter we were hoping for, but things should improve. Management will cut 10M of OpEx this year, interest expense will decrease by 2-3M (since 90M of debt was paid off with the HIrschman sale), sales growth should pick up 2H18 with the start of some new OEM infotainment programs, and the Eyelock sales pipeline is growing.

10/11/17: -20% on 2Q17. Sold Hirschman Car Communication Division for 177M, and market cap of whole company is 207M. Will use cash to reduce net debt to 19M. 2Q 2018 sales down 4% from 118M to 114M mainly due to lower OEM sales, as an international program ended in 1Q 2018 and domestic OEM sales were impacted by winding down of certain headrest programs with 2 OEM customers in anticipation of new programs beginning 3Q 2018 and 4Q 2018. Management says new OEM programs to car manufacturers will make margins go back up, confident 2H 2018 will be profitable after 1H loss. The Consumer Accessories division will see the launch of some new products at Best Buy.

Interestingly, competitor Elekta (EKTAF) (whose machine, Unity, does the same thing but with slightly different technology) took an equity stake in VRAY in 2019. The explanation behind this is that both companies realize it will be an uphill battle to get radiation oncologists to change their treatment process and switch over to an MRI-radiation combo machine, so better to sort of combine forces in order to disrupt the field.

The company only has one candidate, VRS-317. It was announced Friday that it failed to meet a primary endpoint in phase 3 trial. At the moment, the treatment for growth disorder involves a daily injection that must be refrigerated. Its widely accepted by physicians that there is massive non-compliance with the daily injections, both because of inconvenience and distaste for injections in general. VSAR was offering a twice-monthly injection. There were two arms of the study. In the intent-to-treat arm, VSAR missed by .3cm. So even though the observed measurements of VSAR missed in a theoretical sense, in a practical sense .3cm is very negligible. In the per-protocol-population arm, non-inferiority was demonstrated. Its worth noting that VSARs drug has a better safety profile vs the current standard, and resulted in less discontinuation rates. The point is that even though it technically failed, if physicians and patients are given a choice, they might choose a drug that works slightly less than what is currently available, but that only has to be taken twice per month, and is more tolerable. There is a phase 3 trial in Japan set to start for the same candidate. The bad thing is VSAR only has this one drug, but the good thing is that they have 140M in cash (with current market cap of 100M), and are burning about 30M per quarter. This will go down as the phase 3 results have been announced. There is strong sentiment on SA that they can still obtain FDA approval. There are two other trials from other companies for weekly injections, but results are at least one year away.

September 2018: Beginning of decline from $25/share. Market fatigue probably set in due to IPO hype receding, as well as a delayed NDA filing for Gvoke. 

PIPELINE:

Gvoke (hypoglycemia): US launch for hypopen 7/1/20. EU pre-filled syringe decision 1H21. Glucagon has been used for decades to treat low blood sugar levels. Gvoke comes in an easy-to-use, room temperature, injectable form that does not require mixing. XERS showed non-inferiority against Eli Lillys GEK and Novo Nordisks GlucaGen, which both require mixing (1). Fresenius Kabi also has an injector that requires mixing. A nasal spray from Eli Lilly called BAQSIMI was also recently approved (7/24/19), and showed comparable results to injectable glucagon. Anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that if a patient (likely a child) blows their nose after spraying, the efficacy wont be realized, so an auto-injector has this advantage over the spray. However, ZEAL has an identical product to Gvoke that has shown positive results through phase 3 (2), and is about one year behind XERS.

PIPELINE:

Brand A: PMTA for VLN cigarettes accepted for filing January 2019 (currently in review phase 3 of 4). MRPTA for VLN cigarettes accepted for review and now in review phase 2 of 4. Would be considered a very low nicotine item (VLN). This would be the go-to product for those who still prefer cigarettes once the FDA moves forward with its goal of reducing nicotine in cigarettes to non-addictive levels (announced 7/28/17). XXII is embarking on 3 new limited studies showing the benefits of this type of cigarette. The timeframe is likely 1H19 for study completion. These studies should bolster their MRPTA claim, and once approved, would allow them to sell their own cigarettes.

Brand B: This would offer an alternative to vape pens, e-cigs, etc. Its a modified-risk tobacco product (high nicotine blend with lower amounts of carbon monoxide and tar). 

X-22: A prescription smoking cessation product up for phase 3. Would compete with Nicoderm CQ or Chantix, which had sales of 671M worldwide in 2015. X-22 did not meet statistical significance in 2012 for phase 2 when compared with conventional cigarettes in a study designed to test quitting smoking, but if FDA nicotine mandate goes through, it wouldnt matter.

Reported positive top-line results from its global Phase 3 clinical trial (Study 1601) of FINTEPLA in LGS. The high dose arm met its primary objective, but statistical significance not reached in lower dose arm. The high dose arm also demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo in key secondary efficacy measures, but did miss one one secondary measure (proportion of patients improved). FINTEPLA was generally well-tolerated, with the adverse events consistent with those observed in two prior Phase 3 studies in Dravet syndrome. There was one death reported in the higher dose arm, but they say it was unrelated to study drug. The reason its down is probably because of mixed efficacy on secondary endpoints, an expectation that the results would be as robust as for Dravet syndrome,  and because GWPHs results are better in absolute terms for LGS (7). However, as is discussed in the PIPELINE section, its not so clear-cut which drug is better because the drugs are different compounds administered at different doses. ZGNX has better results for Dravet Syndrome but GWPH now has better results for LGS. I would say this is a good volatility pick as this might be an overreaction.

Receives an RTF letter from FDA for 2 issues relating to Fintepla for Dravet syndrome NDA: 1) certain non-clinical toxicology studies were not submitted, and 2) an incorrect data set was submitted. The FDA has not recommended or required any additional efficacy or safety studies. The second issue seems very easily corrected. The first issue could simply cause a 6-9 month delay. On the conference call they said that from previous discussions with the FDA, they were under the impression that submitting historical toxicology study data would suffice. The FDA apparently did not see it that way. They are seeking an immediate type A meeting to clarify, but if they have to conduct their own toxicology study, it will take 6-9 months. Some of the analysts have cut their PTs a bit, but all PTs remain in the 50+ range. This announcement does not affect the MAA in the EU at all (a decision is expected 1Q20).

PIPELINE:

FINTEPLA (ZX008) (Dravet syndrome): FDA approval 6/25/20. US launch 6/27/20. US/EU Orphan and Pediatric Drug. Seeking Orphan Drug in Japan. Fintepla is a low-dose version of fenfluramine (a drug that was pulled from the market in the 1990s due to caridiovascular issues (1)) that is to be taken in addition to general seizure medications. Most patients seizures remain uncontrolled even on many epileptic drugs. On 9/29/17, ZGNX reported great phase 3 results for Study 1 that sent the stock soaring (4). '\n''\n'In addition to showing great efficacy, no development of valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension was observed in any patient, which was a big relief. The adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of fenfluramine (decreased appetite, fatigue, etc.) and are also comparable to GWPHs Epidiolex (the first CBD-based drug approved by FDA and MAA, and also taken in addition to general seizure medications). However, its not clear if Feinteplas rate of AEs is higher than Epidiolexs rate of 10%. '\n''\n'Since safety is no longer such a concern, the main question becomes how Fintepla will fare compared to Epidiolex based on efficacy and price. Epidiolex showed a median reduction of convulsive seizure frequency  of -39% vs -13% placebo (p=0.01) (5, Section 14.2). Fintepla showed a 72% median reduction vs 17% placebo. Also, the Fintepla dose (0.8 mg/kg/day) was lower than Epidiolex (20 mg/kg/day). And the baseline periods for ZGNX and GWPHs studies were different (6 weeks vs 4 weeks). In general we should not make cross-study comparisons, and as Fintepla and Epidiolex are different compounds, we should not compare dosages. Its not so clear cut which is better.'\n''\n'A final risk to mention is that some patients may simply opt for CBD, the active ingredient in Epidiolex. But if insurance is paying for Fintepla or Epidiolex then this is unlikely.'\n''\n'FINTEPLA (ZX008) (LGS): US/EU Orphan and Pediatric Drug. Seeking Orphan Drug in Japan.'\n''\n'FINTEPLA (ZX008) (Doose syndrome and other rare epilepsies): Phase 2 initiated 4Q19.'\n''\n'MT1621 (TK2 Deficiency): Phase 2. FDA Breakthrough Therapy. EMA Prime designation. Currently no approved therapies. Current treatment is limited to supportive care. Thus far the only data we have are from preclinical mouse models (strong survival data) and phase 2 RETRO historical control trial. Preliminary phase 2 RETRO data showed a statistically significant survival rate in treated vs untreated (natural history groups) patients. MT1621 was generally safe and well tolerated, but did show high rate of mild-to-moderate diarrhea (63%), some SAEs due to study drug (n=4/38, 11%), and two discontinuations due to increased liver enzymes (n=2/38, 5%). Given the severity of this indication, these side effects seem acceptable.

ZMTP is doing well selling its cable modems in the DTC channel, going from single-digit market share in 2016 to 30% today (driven by best-in-class designs that receive top consumer ratings on Amazon). However, cable modem DTC sales make up only 5% of the market. The other 95% of cable modem sales is B2B, where ZMTPs share is practically zero.

First-line treatments of topical steroid sprays and oral steroids do not stay localized at the point of need and have poor patient compliance rates. Second-line treatment of endoscopic sinus surgery is invasive, painful, complicated, and expensive ($14k) (1, slide 12). LYRA's approach is to non-invasively place a biocompatible mesh scaffold into the nasal cavity that will slowly release a topical steroid over a period of 6 months. Topline results for the phase 2 LANTERN study (12/7/20) showed that statistical significance was not achieved at week 4 (they believe because of curtailed enrollment due to COVID), but was achieved at weeks 16, 20, and 24. The results seem ok, but not game-changing. Management says the prevalence of CRS is 14M in the US, but the fact that only 400k get surgery (and that many patients stop taking their nasal spray) means that while this condition may be very uncomfortable sometimes, it's something that you just live with.

SNGX is a biotech that has two areas of focus: 1) a specialized therapeutics segment (orphan diseases such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, oral mucositis, pediatric Crohns disease, and acute radiation enteritis), and 2) a public health segment involving vaccine and biodefense applications with specific programs in the prevention of ricin intoxication, the treatment of acute radiation syndrome, and the prevention/treatment of emerging and antibiotic-resistant infectious disease. The Public Health segment candidates are still relatively early stage. The two lead candidates for the Specialized Therapeutics segment are SGX301 for Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) and SGX942 for oral mucositis (OM). SGX942 failed phase 3 (12/22/20) and investors were clearly disappointed given that phase 2 results had been very good (management does not yet have an explanation but says there was clinical benefit). SGX301 has demonstrated consistently positive phase 3 results for CTCL but it has not moved the stock at all. The US market for CTCL is small at $75M, and the 5-yr survival rate for patients that are identified early is 88%. The creams/injections currently available have some side effects but they seem to have efficacy rates equivalent to SGX301. Management also claims that SGX301, which uses fluorescent light, is safer than the current therapies that use UV light. But the evidence on UV therapies causing skin cancer is also mixed, with some studies showing they are perfectly safe (4). I think the market feels that SNGX has not advanced the science at all with respect to CTCL, and this is why the stock is not moving. This came close to being a Top Idea, but I agree with the market's indifference.

Despite this clinically meaningful improvement, the variability in the distribution of the data yielded a p-value that was not statistically significant. Other secondary endpoints supported the biological activity of dusquetide, including a 50% reduction in the duration of SOM, which decreased from 18 days in the placebo group to 9 days in the SGX942 treatment group (p=0.049), consistent with the findings in the Phase 2 trial. The company will further analyze why the study did not meet expectations.'\n''\n'PIPELINE:'\n''\n'SGX301 (CTCL): Orphan Drug. Announced additional positive data from phase 3 FLASH trial on 10/22/20 but so far the market does not react much to SGX301 data readouts. US market size $75M+. Global market $250M. SGX301 consists of a topical ointment patients apply at home followed by fluorescent light therapy at the dermatologist office (they claim this is safer than UV therapies). The 1st line standard of care consists of topical steroids (not always efficacious, not approved for CTCL). The 2nd line consists of POTELIGEO injection (5) (highly toxic), Mechlorethamine injections/gels such as Valchlor (2017 global sales $35M after US launch in 2013 (6)) (highly toxic but low rates of non-melanoma skin cancer), topical retinoid skin creams (excessive irritation and blistering), and nbUVB and PUVA, both types of phototherapies (not approved for CTCL, extended use can cause melanoma . . . though the evidence of how riskier they are is mixed (4)). Despite no FDA-approved 1st line therapy and the side effects of the 2nd line therapies, the 5-yr survival rate for CTCL patients if caught early is 88%. CTCL lesions can be itchy, painful, and cosmetically unbecoming, but it doesn't seem so serious a condition. Also, only 16% of patients responded during Cycle 1 (6 weeks) vs 4% placebo. The efficacy improved for Cycle 2 (12 weeks) to 40% and then for Cycle 3 (18 weeks) jumped to 49% (3). But I think the high current survival rate is why the market has not pushed the stock up even though their data readouts have been positive (the dermatologist on the 3/19/20 call said that patients that don't have progressive disease may live 20 or 30 years after diagnosis).

The target gross margins on each EV ARC range from -8% (the least profitable model) to 4% (the most profitable model), but through 3Q20 the gross margin was -15% and there is no sign of improvements. And since 2010, the CEO's pay has amounted to 20% of the company's revenues. Each EV ARC can only deliver up to 245 miles of charging range per day (split amongst all users), so maybe the economics of non-grid-connected EV chargers just don't make sense right now.

FREQ,0.00,0.00,2021-03-23,9.21,"3/23/21 BO -75% 9.21 FREQ THESIS: Cash 224M, management cash runway into 2023 (does not include potential milestones from Astellas Pharma).is using novel progenitor cell stimulating technology to regrow hair cells in the ear and improve hearing loss in patients. FREQ lead candidate FX-322's four-dose regime fails to separate from placebo and show improved hearing loss in phase 2a trial. Management says the placebo group showed an unexpected apparent level of hearing benefit in the placebo group that did not occur in previous trials and exceeded well-established published standards, potentially suggesting bias due to trial design. They may reconsider multi-dose trials in the future, but are discontinuing the phase 2a at this time. In a parallel phase 1 study that tested a single dose of FX-322, 34% of subjects achieved a 10% or greater absolute improvement in word recognition (WR) scores, which was clinically meaningful and statistically significant compared to the untreated ear (p &lt;0.05). Also, a subset of patients more than doubled their WR scores. These phase 1 results match previous results of another single-dose study that showed statistically significant improvements in speech intelligibility. They are thus continuing with single-dose testing only. Peak sales estimates ranged from $2B - $5B (see JPMorgan upgrade on 1/27/21), indicating the transformational potential of this candidate and their approach. The rest of the pipeline is phase 1 or below but if their approach to get the body to repair itself works, this could be broadly applicable to MS, etc. The fact that the higher doses didn't separate from placebo is concerning, though it could eventually turn out that there was in fact bias in the placebo group. A bit too much risk here to bet big, but seems deserving of a small position. q4'\n''\n''\n'CATALYSTS:'\n''\n''\n'VALUATION:'\n''\n''\n'2021 EPS avg'\n'price'\n'fwd PE'\n''\n''\n'LIQUIDITY:'\n'as of 9/30/20'\n'current debt M'\n'long-term debt M'\n''\n''\n'SEASONALITY:'\n''\n''\n'SUMMARY:'\n''\n''\n'EVENTS:'\n''\n''\n'PIPELINE:'\n''\n''\n'GLOSSARY:'\n''\n''\n'SOURCES:",,,,9.13,9.21,,,,0.00
